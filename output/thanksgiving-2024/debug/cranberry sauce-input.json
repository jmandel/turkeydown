This is a good base for all sorts of variations to your taste.\",\n      \"datePublished\": \"2019-11-28T06:46:58.000Z\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Review\",\n      \"author\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Person\",\n        \"name\": \"HK\"\n      },\n      \"reviewBody\": \"Might be the tastiest cake I’ve ever made\",\n      \"datePublished\": \"2020-11-25T20:36:08.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExtracted Text:\n[]\n\n-   What to Cook[]\n-   Recipes[]\n-   Ingredients[]\n-   Occasions[]\n-   About[]\n\n[]\n\nWhat to Cook\n\nRecipes\n\nIngredients\n\nOccasions\n\nAbout\n\n-   Staff Picks\n\n    -   Christmas Cookies\n    -   Best Holiday Recipes\n    -   Sheet-Pan Vegetarian Recipes\n    -   Easy Side Dishes\n    -   Holiday Appetizers\n\n-   From Our Newsletters\n\n    -   The Cooking Newsletter\n    -   Five Weeknight Dishes\n    -   The Veggie\n\n-   Perfect For\n\n    -   One-Pot Dinners\n    -   Weeknight Chicken\n    -   Quick Pastas\n    -   30 Minute Vegetarian\n    -   Easy Baking\n\n-   Everyday Recipes\n\n    -   Easy\n    -   Healthy\n    -   Weeknight\n    -   Pasta\n    -   Quick\n\n-   By Meal\n\n    -   Dinner\n    -   Breakfast\n    -   Lunch\n    -   Desserts\n    -   Appetizers\n    -   Side Dishes\n    -   Drinks\n\n-   By Diet\n\n    -   Vegetarian\n    -   Vegan\n    -   Gluten-Free\n    -   Dairy-Free\n\n-   By Method\n\n    -   Air Fryer\n    -   Instant Pot\n    -   Slow Cooker\n    -   BBQ & Grilling\n    -   Sheet Pan\n    -   Baking\n\n-   Meat & Seafood\n\n    -   Chicken\n    -   Beef\n    -   Pork\n    -   Salmon\n    -   Shrimp\n\n-   Vegetables & Fruits\n\n    -   Zucchini\n    -   Sweet Potato\n    -   Eggplant\n    -   Cabbage\n    -   Asparagus\n    -   Tomato\n\n-   Plant-Based Proteins\n\n    -   Tofu\n    -   Lentil\n    -   Chickpea\n    -   Bean\n\n-   Rice, Grains, Pasta\n\n    -   Pasta\n    -   Noodles\n    -   Rice\n    -   Quinoa\n    -   Bread\n    -   Couscous\n\n-   By Upcoming Holiday\n\n    -   Thanksgiving\n    -   Hanukkah\n    -   Noche Buena\n    -   Christmas\n\n-   By Occasion\n\n    -   Birthdays\n    -   Brunch\n    -   Date Night\n    -   Parties\n    -   Picnics\n\n-   -   About Us\n    -   The New York Times Food Section\n\n[]\n\n[]\n\n[]\n\n[]\n\n[]\n\nWhat to Cook\n\nStaff Picks\n\n-   Christmas Cookies\n-   Best Holiday Recipes\n-   Sheet-Pan Vegetarian Recipes\n-   Easy Side Dishes\n-   Holiday Appetizers\n\nFrom Our Newsletters\n\n-   The Cooking Newsletter\n-   Five Weeknight Dishes\n-   The Veggie\n\nPerfect For\n\n-   One-Pot Dinners\n-   Weeknight Chicken\n-   Quick Pastas\n-   30 Minute Vegetarian\n-   Easy Baking\n\nRecipes\n\nEveryday Recipes\n\n-   Easy\n-   Healthy\n-   Weeknight\n-   Pasta\n-   Quick\n\nBy Meal\n\n-   Dinner\n-   Breakfast\n-   Lunch\n-   Desserts\n-   Appetizers\n-   Side Dishes\n-   Drinks\n\nBy Diet\n\n-   Vegetarian\n-   Vegan\n-   Gluten-Free\n-   Dairy-Free\n\nBy Method\n\n-   Air Fryer\n-   Instant Pot\n-   Slow Cooker\n-   BBQ & Grilling\n-   Sheet Pan\n-   Baking\n\nIngredients\n\nMeat & Seafood\n\n-   Chicken\n-   Beef\n-   Pork\n-   Salmon\n-   Shrimp\n\nVegetables & Fruits\n\n-   Zucchini\n-   Sweet Potato\n-   Eggplant\n-   Cabbage\n-   Asparagus\n-   Tomato\n\nPlant-Based Proteins\n\n-   Tofu\n-   Lentil\n-   Chickpea\n-   Bean\n\nRice, Grains, Pasta\n\n-   Pasta\n-   Noodles\n-   Rice\n-   Quinoa\n-   Bread\n-   Couscous\n\nOccasions\n\nBy Upcoming Holiday\n\n-   Thanksgiving\n-   Hanukkah\n-   Noche Buena\n-   Christmas\n\nBy Occasion\n\n-   Birthdays\n-   Brunch\n-   Date Night\n-   Parties\n-   Picnics\n\nAbout\n\n-   About Us\n-   The New York Times Food Section\n\nCranberry Sauce\n\nBy Sam Sifton\n\nUpdated Nov. 4, 2024\n\n[Cranberry Sauce]\n\nJim Wilson/The New York Times\n\nTotal Time\n    10 minutes, plus chilling\n\nRating\n    4[][][][][](3,228)\n\nNotes\n    Read community notes[]\n\nCranberry sauce should be sweet but not cloying, and tart without\ncausing pucker and anguish. It should have a jelly-like quality, but\nshould owe more to the appearance of jam. The key element to making\ncranberry sauce is to understand that cranberries are high in pectin, a\ncarbohydrate that exists in many fruits and which is released by the\nberries when they are heated and the cells of the fruit break down. In\nthe presence of sugar, the pectin molecules bond to one another, forming\na kind of gel. The longer you cook a cranberry sauce, the more pectin is\nreleased and liquid is evaporated, and the stiffer the result will be.\nScience! Sometimes it's helpful. So is spice. Some like a clove or two\nadded to their cranberry sauce. (I am not one of them.) Others, a\nwhisper of ginger and a small handful of nuts, for texture. Of this, I\napprove.

I usually end up adding another 1/3 cup\nof sugar - it really depends on your cranberries. I find that adding the\norange juice after it's really thick tastes better - cooked orange juice\ncan be bitter. I add the fresh zest at the same time. Delicious!\n\nIs this helpful?[] 285\n\nMarguerite6 years ago\n\nA tipple of Grand Marnier as it cools is a nice touch.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 166\n\nbetteirene6 years ago\n\nThis sauce is so good on sandwiches made with leftover turkey: Sturdy\nwhite or wheat bread, mayo, swiss, turkey, sauce, lettuce (or not). I\nkeep a bag or two of cranberries in the basement freezer just to make\nthis sauce for sandwiches during non-holiday times of the year. I like\nit on ham sandwiches, too.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 75\n\nKatherine6 years ago\n\nFor us, this was just too sweet and too orange-y, even with only 1/2 cup\nsugar. Next time we'll go back to the tried-and-true orange zest plus\nwater, not juice.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 51\n\nPatty H.6 years ago\n\nI follow the recipe on the bag of fresh cranberries adding water and\norange in equal amounts. I add a generous amount of orange zest and a\npiece of fresh peeled ginger root cut into slices which I remove after\nthe cranberry sauce has chilled. That definitely kicks it up a notch.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 46\n\nhavaiisteve4 years ago\n\nI usually make another dish that requires I strain the juice from a can\nof pineapple bits. I use the pineapple juice in place of the orange\njuice. The dish is very popular with our friends and is requested for\nT'day pot luck dinners\n\nIs this helpful?[] 30\n\nAnne NYC4 years ago\n\nI did not have Grand Marnier but added a tipple of Cointreau, which is\nalso an orange liqueuer. Grated ginger and orange rind. And this keeps\nfor months in a glass jar in the fridge. Great on toasted english\nmuffins!\n\nIs this helpful?[] 25\n\nrrp6 years ago\n\nAgree with other commenters - just too sweet. I fixed with a squirt of\nlemon juice.

I add sugar as I go I don’t like it too\nsweet. Depending on my mood I’ll add either vanilla or grand marnier but\nlately it’s been vanilla then add the zest. After Canadian then American\nthanksgiving and xmas I am all in for cranberry sauce on toast because\nreally it’s the best ever jam!\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nJoe1 week ago\n\nThe sweeter the better. One cup of sugar, zest an orange, juice the\norange, throw the whole thing in the pot while the berries are cooking.\nDon't forget the cinnamon stick. Delicious. I then refrigerate, if\nthere's anything left over, leaving the orange rind and cinnamon stick\nin with the cranberry sauce...heightens the flavor.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nJanet A1 week ago\n\nI add garam masala to the cranberry sauce in the last minute or two of\ncooking.

How do I make cranberry sauce?[]\n\n    To make cranberry sauce, you need three ingredients: cranberries,\n    sugar and cooking liquid. Combine fresh or frozen cranberries with\n    sugar and liquid, such as orange juice or water, in a saucepan over\n    medium-high. Cook until the sugar dissolves and cranberries burst.\n    Stir, adding seasonings like orange or lemon zest, or spices if you\n    like, then cook a few more minutes, until saucy. Let the cranberry\n    sauce cool, then transfer to a serving dish, cover and chill in the\n    refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving.\n\n2.  Can you freeze cranberry sauce? []\n\n    Any cranberry sauce made without gelatin can be stored in an\n    airtight container in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw in the\n    refrigerator overnight before serving. Cranberry molds, or any other\n    sauce that is set with gelatin, cannot be frozen.\n\n3.  What should I do with leftover cranberry sauce?[]\n\n    Leftover cranberry sauce can be used like a jam or jelly to spread\n    on sandwiches. You can also make a salsa with it, combine it with\n    whipped cream and yogurt for an easy treat or dessert topping,\n    slather it on pancakes or waffles or even bake it into a hot\n    pocket. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCredits\n\nThanksgiving: How to Cook It Well by Sam Sifton\n\nRecipe Tags\n\n-   American\n-   Condiments\n-
