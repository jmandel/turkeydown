Step 1\n\n    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and fill a large bowl\n    with ice water. Working in two batches, boil beans until just tender\n    but still crisp and bright green. Start testing after 4 minutes or\n    so, being careful not to overcook. When done, plunge beans into ice\n    water to stop cooking, lift out immediately when cool and drain on\n    towels. (Recipe can be made to this point up to a day in advance and\n    kept refrigerated, wrapped in towels.)\n\n2.  Step 2\n\n    When ready to cook, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wide skillet over\n    high heat. Add half the beans, half the ginger and half the garlic,\n    and cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until beans are heated\n    through and ginger and garlic are softened and aromatic. Sprinkle\n    with salt, and remove to a serving dish. Repeat with remaining oil,\n    beans, ginger and garlic. Serve.\n\nSimilar Recipes\n\n[]\n\n-   \n    [Green Beans With Lime and Red Onions]\n\n    Green Beans With Lime and Red Onions\n\n    Melissa Clark\n-   \n    [Sautéed Green Beans]\n\n    Sautéed Green Beans\n\n    Kia Damon\n-   \n    [Green Beans and Tomatoes]\n\n    Green Beans and Tomatoes\n\n    Millie Peartree\n-   \n    [Crushed Green Bean Salad With Cranberry]\n\n    Crushed Green Bean Salad With Cranberry\n\n    Sohla El-Waylly\n-   \n    [Green Beans With Herbs and Olives]\n\n    Green Beans With Herbs and Olives\n\n    David Tanis\n-   \n    [Pan-Roasted Green Beans With Golden Almonds]\n\n    Pan-Roasted Green Beans With Golden Almonds\n\n    Tara Parker-Pope\n-   \n    [Spicy Black Bean Soup]\n\n    Spicy Black Bean Soup\n\n    Ali Slagle\n-   \n    [Green Beans With Dill]\n\n    Green Beans With Dill\n\n    Amanda Hesser\n-   \n    [Green Bean Salad With Hot Mustard Dressing]\n\n    Green Bean Salad With Hot Mustard Dressing\n\n    Kay Chun\n-   \n    [Rice and Peas]\n\n    Rice and Peas\n\n    Ashley Lonsdale\n-   \n    [Green Bean and Corn Almondine]\n\n    Green Bean and Corn Almondine\n\n    Kay Chun\n-   \n    [French Green Beans and Shallots]\n\n    French Green Beans and Shallots\n\n    Jacques Pepin\n-   \n    [Air-Fryer Green Beans]\n\n    Air-Fryer Green Beans\n\n    Eleanore Park\n-   \n    [Warm Cabbage and Green Beans]\n\n    Warm Cabbage and Green Beans\n\n    Elaine Louie\n-   \n    [Green Beans With Lemon Vinaigrette]\n\n    Green Beans With Lemon Vinaigrette\n\n    Mark Bittman\n-   \n    [Creamy White Beans With Herb Oil]\n\n    Creamy White Beans With Herb Oil\n\n    Colu Henry\n-   \n    [Creamy Braised White Beans]\n\n    Creamy Braised White Beans\n\n    Ali Slagle\n-   \n    [Green Bean Casserole]\n\n    Green Bean Casserole\n\n    Eric Kim\n-   \n    [Bean and Cheese Burritos]\n\n    Bean and Cheese Burritos\n\n    Kay Chun\n-   \n    [Baked Beans With Mint, Peppers and Tomatoes]\n\n    Baked Beans With Mint, Peppers and Tomatoes\n\n    Martha Rose Shulman\n\n[]\n\nRatings\n\n[]\n\n5 out of 5\n\n3,917 user ratings\n\nYour rating\n\n1 star[]2 stars[]3 stars[]4 stars[]5 stars[]\n\nSubmit\n\nLog in or sign up to rate this recipe.\n\nHave you cooked this?\n\n[]Mark as Cooked\n\nLog in or sign up to mark this recipe as cooked.\n\nPrivate Notes\n\nLeave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.\n\nCooking Notes\n\nAdd Note\n\nPublicPrivate\n\nSubmit\n\n-   All Notes\n-   Private\n\nA Mayer7 years ago\n\nI add 1 T of soy sauce and 1 T of White wine vinegar ( or sherry\nvinegar) for a minute, before the ginger and garlic. Delicious.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 388\n\nravelle7 years ago\n\nI never boil beans! They should actually be steamed. Bring the beans to\na boil, then immediately turn off the heat and cover the pot. Let them\nsit for a few minutes, taste one to test, then drain.\nIf you do this, they will be perfect when reheated the next day.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 374\n\nJ. David Nelson7 years ago\n\nAt four minutes of boiling, I had already overcooked the beans. Check\nwell before then.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 237\n\nBoxplayer6 years ago\n\nWe keep bags of fresh ginger in the freezer. When we want to use it in a\nfinely-shredded way, we use a microplane. No need to thaw or peel --\njust grate from frozen.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 227\n\nNeal7 years ago\n\nDon't understand why one would ever boil the beans. Boiling them changes\nthe taste (dilutes the carbohydrates and thus the sweetness) and leaches\nout vitamins and other nutrients. Steaming cooks them more quickly\nbecause steam has a higher temperature than boiling water.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 183\n\nJanet7 years ago\n\nI stop cooking as soon as the color turns bright. Since garlic burns and\nturns bitter very quickly on high heat I get the beans heated through,\nthen add ginger to warm up, add the garlic last, just to warm up and\nscent the air. For best flavor, do not let garlic color beyond golden,\nremove from pan immediately.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 122\n\nEdward Baker7 years ago\n\nWith 2 1/2 lbs of beans, this works very well in a wok, do the whole\nthing in one shot. And if you throw in a few mushrooms it works even\nbetter.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 109\n\nLuckyJustLucky7 years ago\n\nCooked bean 2 minutes Added soy sauce to ginger and garlic, cut the oil\nin half\n\nIs this helpful?[] 80\n\nTommi-Grace7 years ago\n\nI agree with the other posters, the beans get tender VERY quickly and I\nwould start checking even after 1 minute. Also, I melted down a touch of\nbutter in a small sauce pan and added the ginger/garlic mixture- heating\nand stirring for maybe 2 minutes. I then combined it with the beans in\nthe skillet. Delicious results!\n\nIs this helpful?[] 79\n\nSteve7 years ago\n\nI enjoy lightly steaming the beans, not cook them through, then saute\nthem at high heat, adding the garlic, etc. toward the end as not to\nscorch.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 69\n\nLL7 years ago\n\nCook beans 3 minutes and Test for doneness.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 68\n\nEllie7 years ago\n\nThis was awesome!

Grating it on a box\ngrater will work for incorporation of the flavor, or finely chopping it\nwill give you bits of intense flavor.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 61\n\nCypridopsis7 years ago\n\nAdded a little toasted sesame oil to make it more blatantly Asian.

I thought that maybe the recipe was calling for too\nmuch ginger but it married to the garlic and beans wonderfully. To save\ntime, I used packaged--Yes, more expensive-- green beans that had\nalready been cleaned and the stems cut off.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 57\n\nNicole6 hours ago\n\nThank you Miss Moskin, I was looking for such a recipe for my nephew ‘s\nwife!

And trying\nit pulling beans out of boil at 2nin 30 sec. If you want snappy crunch,\nlike the restaurant, skip the boiling. Just throw 'em in an iron skillet\nwith olive oil etc and a lid (to keep oil popping all over) and flip a\ncouple times over a couple minutes. To have it somewhere in between do\nnot boil it over 2 minutes... absolute max. I think this recipe was\nwritten for throwing frozen beans straight from tbe freezer into the\npot, not, fresn beans. There really isn't any reason to boil them.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\njohnrf4 months ago\n\nSeems like a lot of ginger root.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nTara D.5 months ago\n\nThis is my new favorite way to cook fresh green beans!
