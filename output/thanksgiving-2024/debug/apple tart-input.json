The double dose of sesame is used in both the crust and filling, giving a nutty, earthy pop against the natural sweetness of the apples. They get tossed in ground cardamom for a wonderfully sweet, warm scent. Sesame is used twice: First, it becomes a spreadable paste with tahini, butter, sugar and egg, which becomes almost halva-like when combined with the cardamom-scented apples. Second, sesame seeds (and sugar) get sprinkled along the edges of the tart, making for a strikingly beautiful, textured crust. \",\n  \"author\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Person\",\n    \"name\": \"Andy Baraghani\"\n  },\n  \"image\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-square640.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-square640.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 640,\n      \"width\": 640,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-googleFourByThree.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-googleFourByThree.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 600,\n      \"width\": 800,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-videoSmall.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-videoSmall.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 281,\n      \"width\": 500,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 1103,\n      \"width\": 735,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"prepTime\": \"PT40M\",\n  \"cookTime\": \"PT1H30M\",\n  \"totalTime\": \"PT2H10M\",\n  \"recipeYield\": \"8 servings\",\n  \"recipeCuisine\": \"\",\n  \"recipeCategory\": \"dessert\",\n  \"keywords\": \"apple, cardamom, make-ahead, plan-ahead, sesame seed, tahini, tart, fall, thanksgiving\",\n  \"aggregateRating\": {\n    \"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n    \"ratingValue\": 5,\n    \"ratingCount\": 383\n  },\n  \"recipeIngredient\": [\n    \"1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed \",\n    \"1 tablespoon sugar\",\n    \"1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)\",\n    \"3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter, cut into small cubes, chilled \",\n    \"Ice water, as needed\",\n    \"1/3 cup tahini\",\n    \"3 tablespoons sugar \",\n    \"3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature \",\n    \"1 large egg\",\n    \"1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\",\n    \"2 pounds crisp, tart apples such as Honeycrisp or Pink Lady (about 6 medium apples) \",\n    \"1 tablespoon cider vinegar or lemon juice\",\n    \"3 tablespoons sugar, plus more for sprinkling \",\n    \"1 teaspoon ground cardamom\",\n    \"Heavy cream, for brushing \",\n    \"1 to 2 tablespoons white sesame seeds \",\n    \"Vanilla ice cream, whipped cream or crème fraîche, for serving\"\n  ],\n  \"recipeInstructions\": [\n    {\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"HowToStep\",\n      \"text\": \"For the Dough: Whisk together the flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl.

Food Stylist: Barrett Washburne.\n\nTotal Time\n    2 hours 10 minutes, plus 2 hours’ chilling\n\nPrep Time\n    40 minutes\n\nCook Time\n    1 hour and 30 minutes, plus 2 hours’ chilling\n\nRating\n    5[][][][][](383)\n\nNotes\n    Read community notes[]\n\nIf you’re someone who loves a dessert packed with fruit and texture,\nthis apple tart is made for you. The double dose of sesame is used in\nboth the crust and filling, giving a nutty, earthy pop against the\nnatural sweetness of the apples. They get tossed in ground cardamom for\na wonderfully sweet, warm scent. Sesame is used twice: First, it becomes\na spreadable paste with tahini, butter, sugar and egg, which becomes\nalmost halva-like when combined with the cardamom-scented apples.\nSecond, sesame seeds (and sugar) get sprinkled along the edges of the\ntart, making for a strikingly beautiful, textured crust. \n\nRead More\n\n-   []Save\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   []Give\n    Subscriber benefit: give recipes to anyone\n\n    As a subscriber, you have 10 gift recipes to give each month.

Step 1\n\n    For the Dough: Whisk together the flour, sugar and salt in a large\n    bowl. Dump in the cold butter and toss until coated in the flour\n    mixture, separating any pieces that stick together. Use your fingers\n    to smush and flatten each piece once.\n\n2.  Step 2\n\n    Drizzle ¼ cup ice water over the flour mixture. Repeatedly run your\n    fingers through the mixture, as if rummaging through a drawer, until\n    combined. The dough will start out looking dry then become very\n    shaggy. Transfer to a clean work surface and use your palms to knead\n    the dough together, forming a ball with no dry spots. You may need\n    an additional tablespoon or two of ice water to help the dough come\n    together, but even then it will be shaggy, not smooth or shiny.\n\n3.  Step 3\n\n    Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and use your hands to flatten it\n    into a round disc about 1-inch thick. Chill for 2 hours or up to 3\n    days.\n\n4.  Step 4\n\n    Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour and roll out the dough,\n    turning it to prevent it from sticking between rolls, into a 14-inch\n    round. Gently gather both ends of the dough and transfer to a\n    parchment-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate the dough while you make\n    the sesame spread and apple filling.\n\n5.  Step 5\n\n    For the sesame spread: Whisk the tahini, sugar, butter, egg and salt\n    together in a medium bowl until smooth. (You can make the sesame\n    spread 5 days ahead; just bring to room temperature before using, so\n    it spreads easily.)\n\n6.  Step 6\n\n    For the filling: Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Peel, core and thinly\n    slice the apples (see Tip). Toss the apple slices, vinegar, sugar\n    and the cardamom together in a large bowl until the sugar feels like\n    it has dissolved.\n\n7.  Step 7\n\n    Remove the dough from the fridge and plop the sesame spread in the\n    center. Use the back of a spoon to evenly distribute the sesame\n    spread, leaving a 2-inch border. Arrange the apples on top in\n    whatever manner you like. Fold the edges of the dough over the\n    apples to form the crust, then brush the dough with heavy cream and\n    sprinkle with sesame seeds and more sugar.\n\n8.  Step 8\n\n    Bake on the bottom rack for 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the pan\n    halfway through, until the crust is deeply golden brown and the\n    apples are tender. Let cool for 20 minutes before slicing and\n    serving with the topping of your choice.\n\nTip\n\n-   One efficient way to peel, core and thinly slice apples is to first\n    use a vegetable peeler to remove the peels, starting from the stem\n    end and working your way down to the root end. Then, place the\n    apples upright and, using a chef's knife, cut each apple around its\n    core into three pieces, cutting straight down and slightly rotating\n    the apples between cuts. Slice each piece into thin half-moons.\n\nSimilar Recipes\n\n[]\n\n-   \n    [Pomegranate Cardamom Apple Pie]\n\n    Pomegranate Cardamom Apple Pie\n\n    Vaughn Vreeland\n-   \n    [Apple Tart]\n\n    Apple Tart\n\n    Samantha Seneviratne\n-   \n    [Sesame-Swirled Pumpkin Pie]\n\n    Sesame-Swirled Pumpkin Pie\n\n    Vaughn Vreeland\n-   \n    [Rose Apple Tart]\n\n    Rose Apple Tart\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Foolproof Tarte Tatin]\n\n    Foolproof Tarte Tatin\n\n    Julia Moskin\n-   \n    [Mini Apple Tartes Tatin]\n\n    Mini Apple Tartes Tatin\n\n    Julia Moskin\n-   \n    [Thin and Crisp Apple Tart]\n\n    Thin and Crisp Apple Tart\n\n    Tejal Rao\n-   \n    [Coconut Caramel Tart]\n\n    Coconut Caramel Tart\n\n    Vaughn Vreeland\n-   \n    [Caramelized Apple Pie]\n\n    Caramelized Apple Pie\n\n    Claire Saffitz\n-   \n    [Gluten-Free Apple-Almond Tart]\n\n    Gluten-Free Apple-Almond Tart\n\n    Martha Rose Shulman\n-   \n    [Apple Crumble]\n\n    Apple Crumble\n\n    Samantha Seneviratne\n-   \n    [Apple Crisp]\n\n    Apple Crisp\n\n    Genevieve Ko\n-   \n    [Salted Tahini Chocolate Chip Cookies]\n\n    Salted Tahini Chocolate Chip Cookies\n\n    Julia Moskin\n-   \n    [Caramel Apple Pie]\n\n    Caramel Apple Pie\n\n    Genevieve Ko\n-   \n    [Caramelized Onion, Cranberry and Rosemary Tahchin ]\n\n    Caramelized Onion, Cranberry and Rosemary Tahchin \n\n    Andy Baraghani\n-   \n    [Cranberry Citrus Meringue Pie]\n\n    Cranberry Citrus Meringue Pie\n\n    Vaughn Vreeland\n-   \n    [Free-Form Apple Or Pear Tart]\n\n    Free-Form Apple Or Pear Tart\n\n    Mark Bittman\n-   \n    [Skillet Caramel-Apple Crisp]\n\n    Skillet Caramel-Apple Crisp\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Giant Roasted Vegetable Platter]\n\n    Giant Roasted Vegetable Platter\n\n    Melissa Clark\n-   \n    [Apple Cake]\n\n    Apple Cake\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n\n[]\n\nRatings\n\n[]\n\n5 out of 5\n\n383 user ratings\n\nYour rating\n\n1 star[]2 stars[]3 stars[]4 stars[]5 stars[]\n\nSubmit\n\nLog in or sign up to rate this recipe.\n\nHave you cooked this?\n\n[]Mark as Cooked\n\nLog in or sign up to mark this recipe as cooked.\n\nPrivate Notes\n\nLeave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.\n\nCooking Notes\n\nAdd Note\n\nPublicPrivate\n\nSubmit\n\n-   All Notes\n-   Private\n\nJudy2 months ago\n\nI used only one tablespoon of sugar in the spread, one tablespoon of\nsugar in the filling, substituted avocado oil for the butter, and used a\npurchased frozen pie shell.

I used a mix of\nhoneycrisp (sweeter) and cosmic crisp (more tart). You may also want to\ntake out the chilled dough for 10 minutes before you're ready to roll it\nout. And if you have a super basic oven like me where things usually\ntake longer, preheat to 400, drop to 375, and bake for 55-60 minutes.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nML1 week ago\n\nI think this is my favorite crust ever! I made it as instructed except\nusing the food processor. So crumbly and buttery!\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nBirdie2 weeks ago\n\nThis turned out very good. I used a storebought rolled pie crust and it\nworked just fine. I only needed four apples to fill it though. I also\nadded a little cinnamon to the apples, since I find cardamom\noverpowering on its own. The sesame filling did turn out bitter for me,\nso I'm going to see about sourcing a different brand of tahini. The tub\nI got was freshly opened. I also had to bake for 15-20 minutes longer.\nBut all in all this was a neat twist on an old favorite and I will make\nit again.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nOB3 weeks ago\n\nI loved this and would make again for sure. As others have commented,\nit’s not super sweet. I used Fuji apples, medium sized, I packed them in\na tight spiral (almost standing them up in the sticky filling) and used\nabout 4.5 apples). In hindsight I suppose I could have made more flat\nlayers to fit in more, but this result was great. Baked around 65\nminutes to match the golden hue of the photo. Filling was perfect,\npastry was on the crunchy side.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nOB3 weeks ago\n\nI used a mandolin to slice, and did not peel the apples. Would do the\nsame way next time!

Cook time ended up at around an hour, but as\nalways this will depend on your oven, your nose and your preferences.\nThis is a winner in my house: the crust shattered beautifully, the\nsesame was present but not overpowering and the cardamom was delightful.\nWill absolutely make again.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nAnna3 weeks ago\n\nThese are some of my favorite ingredients, but the tahini and cardamon\ndon't come together for me in this dish. They almost cancel each other\nout! I'm dismayed but there it is. Trust me, I really wanted to like\nthis, and I tried twice: first with Honeycrisp apples, and second with\nCosmic Crisp apples and extra demerera sugar on top. The crust was\ntasty, and I liked that with the tahini part. I might simply bake that,\ncool it, and fill it with custard and blackberries.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nstacy in the desert3 weeks ago\n\nI use gf crust for pies. Used a store-bought version and should have par\nbaked it first. The crust was soggy from the tahini butter. A 9” pie\ncrust is a little small for 2lbs of apples. But the flavor was sublime!\nI’m not a big cinnamon fan so the tahini butter and cardamom were\nperfect with the apples. Next attempt will be with homemade gf tart\nshell that is par-baked.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nTony4 weeks ago\n\nIt was different, which was good. Not a lot of added sugar was a plus\ntoo. I made it in a deep dish pie plate which contained the apples\nbetter. It needed more like 70 minutes to bake, both to brown the crust\nand for the apples to soften enough. Maybe needed more spices, cinnamon\nand ginger, to go with less cardamom which otherwise was a little\noverpowering.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nAsia1 month ago\n\n6 apples is way too many to put in this tart. I did end up adding more\nwater, but I’m making this in October and the environmental humidity\ngenuinely may play a role in that. I recommend fresh grinding cardamom\nseeds from cardamom pods.

I would suggest the author make some edits, as it seems a lot\nof folks have had issues.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nCoring the apples1 month ago\n\nThe multiple methods of curing apples with just a knife make me wonder\nwhy more people don't have a simple hand apple corer. They really speed\nup cutting shoes and remove the minimum of flesh.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nJennifer Christian1 month ago\n\nMine is still in the oven, but it is clear this recipe needs editing in\nthree (and maybe 4) places. (1) recipe never says whether this is a\nfree-form tart, or is intended for a shallow tart pan, or is so big it\nshould go in a real pie pan. (2) two lbs of apples is over-generous.\nMany commenters ended up with too many for their pans and mine are piled\nwaaay crazy high. (3) Expected cook time at top of page says 1.5 hrs,\ntext says 40-50, and several commenters had to cook much longer. (4)\nGiven the # of comments re leaking, maybe some thickener is needed.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nPrivate notes are only visible to you.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRecipe Tags\n\n-   Apple\n-   Cardamom\n-   Make Ahead\n-   Plan Ahead\n-   Sesame Seed\n-   Tahini\n-   Tart\n-   Dessert\n-   Fall\n-   Thanksgiving\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLog in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore From Thanksgiving Desserts\n\n[]\n\n-   \n    [Skillet Caramel-Apple Crisp]\n\n    Skillet Caramel-Apple Crisp\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n\n    2299 ratings with an average rating of 5 out of 5 stars[][][][][]\n    2,299\n\n    1 hour\n\n    Save to Recipe Box\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   \n    [Coffee Jelly With Salted Caramel Whipped Cream]\n\n    Coffee Jelly With Salted Caramel Whipped Cream\n\n    Carolina Gelen\n\n    15 ratings with an average rating of 4 out of 5 stars[][][][][]\n    15\n\n    8 ¾ hours\n\n    Save to Recipe Box\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   \n    [Cranberry Pudding]\n\n    Cranberry Pudding\n\n    Carolina Gelen\n\n    15 ratings with an average rating of 4 out of 5 stars[][][][][]\n    15\n\n    5 ¼ hours\n\n    Save to Recipe Box\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   \n    [Sticky Cranberry Gingerbread]\n\n    Sticky Cranberry Gingerbread\n\n    Melissa Clark\n\n    3540 ratings with an average rating of 5 out of 5 stars[][][][][]\n    3,540\n\n    1 1/2 hours plus cooling\n\n    Save to Recipe Box\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   \n    [Rose Apple Tart]\n\n    Rose Apple Tart\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n\n    1577 ratings with an average rating of 5 out of 5 stars[][][][][]\n    1,577\n\n    2 1/2 to 3 hours, plus cooling\n\n    Save to Recipe Box\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   \n    [Tall and Creamy Cheesecake]\n    []\n\n    Tall and Creamy Cheesecake\n\n    Emily Weinstein, Dorie Greenspan\n\n    2843 ratings with an average rating of 5 out of 5 stars[][][][][]\n    2,843\n\n    3 hours 30 minutes, plus at least 4 hours' refrigeration\n\n    Save to Recipe Box\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   Easy\n    [Apple Galette]\n\n    Apple Galette\n\n    Samantha Seneviratne\n\n    255 ratings with an average rating of 5 out of 5 stars[][][][][]\n    255\n\n    2 hours, plus cooling\n\n    Save to Recipe Box\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   \n    [Cranberry Lemon Bars]\n    []\n\n    Cranberry Lemon Bars\n\n    Genevieve Ko\n\n    6098 ratings with an average rating of 4 out of 5 stars[][][][][]\n    6,098\n\n    1 hour, plus cooling and chilling\n\n    Save to Recipe Box\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   \n    [Gâteau Nana]\n\n    Gâteau Nana\n\n    Lisa Donovan, Melissa M.
