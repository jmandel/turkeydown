    "content": "Here's a simple recipe for sautéed broccoli rabe with garlic and red pepper flakes:\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 bunch broccoli rabe (rapini), trimmed\n- 4-5 cloves garlic, thinly sliced\n- 2-3 tablespoons olive oil\n- 1/4-1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)\n- Salt to taste\n- Black pepper to taste\n\nInstructions:\n1. Trim tough ends from broccoli rabe and cut into 2-inch pieces.\n\n2. Bring a pot of salted water to boil. Blanch broccoli rabe for 1-2 minutes, then drain and shock in ice water. Drain well.\n\n3. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.\n\n4. Add sliced garlic and red pepper flakes, cooking until garlic is lightly golden (1-2 minutes).\n\n5. Add blanched broccoli rabe to the pan and sauté for 3-5 minutes until tender-crisp.\n\n6. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.\n\n7. Serve hot.\n\nOptional: Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice or a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.\n\nNote: Blanching helps reduce bitterness in broccoli rabe, but you can skip this step if you prefer.\n",
