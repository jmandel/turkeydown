Remove all the seeds\n    and stringy pulp around the seeds. Place the squash halves cut-side\n    facing down on a baking sheet. Roast in a 400F oven for about 30\n    minutes or until a knife pierces the flesh like soft butter. Remove\n    from the oven and allow to cool a bit. Scoop out the roasted flesh\n    and discard the skins. Mash by hand with a potato masher, or if you\n    wish, purée with a hand blender until smooth. Measure out 1/2 cup of\n    squash purée. Chill the purée in the fridge.\n\n2.  2\n\n    In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and\n    baking soda. Using a box grater, grate the cold butter into the\n    flour mixture. Place this mixture in the freezer while you prepare\n    the wet ingredients (about 5 to 10 minutes).\n\n3.  3\n\n    In another bowl, mix the chilled cream, squash purée, and finely\n    chopped sage. Whisk together until smooth. In another smaller bowl,\n    make the egg wash by beating the egg and 1 Tbsp. of milk together.\n\n4.  4\n\n    Remove the dry ingredients from the freezer. With a pastry cutter or\n    your hands, make sure the grated butter is fully incorporated into\n    the flour (it should look like bread crumbs). Gently add the squash\n    and cream mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring just until the\n    dough starts to come together. Using your hands, lightly knead the\n    dough in the bowl, until uniform, but avoiding overhandling it.\n\n5.  5\n\n    Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour and either roll or\n    simply press the dough out to 3/4 inch thickness. Using a 2 1/2 inch\n    round or square cookie cutter, cut out the biscuits. Brush the tops\n    with egg wash and gently press a whole sage leaf on top of each\n    biscuit. Place on a lightly buttered baking sheet. Bake for 12 to 15\n    minutes in a 400F oven, until golden on top. Transfer the biscuits\n    to a cooling rack and serve warm.\n\nPin Us!\n\nI am on a full-out squash kick lately. After last week's roasted squash\ncrème brûlée, I hope you'll indulge me in one more squash recipe. This\none brings together the sweetness of delicata squash and the festive\nflavour of fresh sage in a tender buttery biscuit. The squash gives a\nlovely golden hue to these biscuits which are flecked with tiny pieces\nof chopped sage.\n\nSquash and sage make a mighty tasty pair, it must be said. Delicata is a\nlesser-known squash, though I don't understand why because in my\nopinion, its flavor and texture is unparalleled. It's well-worth seeking\nit out and getting acquainted with it!\n\nIt also goes by the name of sweet potato squash and it is rich, sweet,\nand creamy.\n\nThis recipe is inspired by the sweet potato biscuits in Kinfolk's new\ncookbook, The Kinfolk Table, which is a delightful visual feast, packed\nwith enticing recipes. Since I had plenty of delicatas on hand, I\nthought I would use them instead of the sweet potato and add a little\nfresh sage to make a Thanksgiving-themed biscuit that is a great\naccompaniment to a seasonal soup or festive dinner. I also followed some\nuseful biscuit-making tips from my fellow PBS Food blogger, Adrianna of\nA Cozy Kitchen, who is an expert biscuit-baker.\n\nI'm quite certain these biscuits would be equally delicious if made with\nanother variety of squash, or sweet potato. But if you can get your\nhands on some delicata squash, I do recommend it.
