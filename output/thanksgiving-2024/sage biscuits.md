Ingredients

1 medium-small delicata squash (½ cup squash purée)

2 cups unbleached white flour

2 ½ tsp. baking powder

½ tsp. baking soda

2 Tbsp. cane sugar

1 tsp. salt

6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, chilled

1 small bunch of fresh sage (1 ½ tsp. chopped and 10 whole leaves for
garnish)

¾ cup heavy cream

For the egg wash:

1 small egg

1 Tbsp. milk

Instructions

1.  1

    Slice the delicata squash in half, lengthwise. Remove all the seeds
    and stringy pulp around the seeds. Place the squash halves cut-side
    facing down on a baking sheet. Roast in a 400F oven for about 30
    minutes or until a knife pierces the flesh like soft butter. Remove
    from the oven and allow to cool a bit. Scoop out the roasted flesh
    and discard the skins. Mash by hand with a potato masher, or if you
    wish, purée with a hand blender until smooth. Measure out 1/2 cup of
    squash purée. Chill the purée in the fridge.

2.  2

    In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and
    baking soda. Using a box grater, grate the cold butter into the
    flour mixture. Place this mixture in the freezer while you prepare
    the wet ingredients (about 5 to 10 minutes).

3.  3

    In another bowl, mix the chilled cream, squash purée, and finely
    chopped sage. Whisk together until smooth. In another smaller bowl,
    make the egg wash by beating the egg and 1 Tbsp. of milk together.

4.  4

    Remove the dry ingredients from the freezer. With a pastry cutter or
    your hands, make sure the grated butter is fully incorporated into
    the flour (it should look like bread crumbs). Gently add the squash
    and cream mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring just until the
    dough starts to come together. Using your hands, lightly knead the
    dough in the bowl, until uniform, but avoiding overhandling it.

5.  5

    Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour and either roll or
    simply press the dough out to 3/4 inch thickness. Using a 2 1/2 inch
    round or square cookie cutter, cut out the biscuits. Brush the tops
    with egg wash and gently press a whole sage leaf on top of each
    biscuit. Place on a lightly buttered baking sheet. Bake for 12 to 15
    minutes in a 400F oven, until golden on top. Transfer the biscuits
    to a cooling rack and serve warm.

I am on a full-out squash kick lately. After last week's roasted squash
crème brûlée, I hope you'll indulge me in one more squash recipe. This
one brings together the sweetness of delicata squash and the festive
flavour of fresh sage in a tender buttery biscuit. The squash gives a
lovely golden hue to these biscuits which are flecked with tiny pieces
of chopped sage.

Squash and sage make a mighty tasty pair, it must be said. Delicata is a
lesser-known squash, though I don't understand why because in my
opinion, its flavor and texture is unparalleled. It's well-worth seeking
it out and getting acquainted with it!

It also goes by the name of sweet potato squash and it is rich, sweet,
and creamy.

This recipe is inspired by the sweet potato biscuits in Kinfolk's new
cookbook, The Kinfolk Table, which is a delightful visual feast, packed
with enticing recipes. Since I had plenty of delicatas on hand, I
thought I would use them instead of the sweet potato and add a little
fresh sage to make a Thanksgiving-themed biscuit that is a great
accompaniment to a seasonal soup or festive dinner. I also followed some
useful biscuit-making tips from my fellow PBS Food blogger, Adrianna of
A Cozy Kitchen, who is an expert biscuit-baker.

I'm quite certain these biscuits would be equally delicious if made with
another variety of squash, or sweet potato. But if you can get your
hands on some delicata squash, I do recommend it. Enjoy!
