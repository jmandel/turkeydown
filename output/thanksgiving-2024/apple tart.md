  "description": "If you’re someone who loves a dessert packed with fruit and texture, this apple tart is made for you. The double dose of sesame is used in both the crust and filling, giving a nutty, earthy pop against the natural sweetness of the apples. They get tossed in ground cardamom for a wonderfully sweet, warm scent. Sesame is used twice: First, it becomes a spreadable paste with tahini, butter, sugar and egg, which becomes almost halva-like when combined with the cardamom-scented apples. Second, sesame seeds (and sugar) get sprinkled along the edges of the tart, making for a strikingly beautiful, textured crust. ",

Tahini Apple Tart

If you’re someone who loves a dessert packed with fruit and texture,
this apple tart is made for you. The double dose of sesame is used in
both the crust and filling, giving a nutty, earthy pop against the
natural sweetness of the apples. They get tossed in ground cardamom for
a wonderfully sweet, warm scent. Sesame is used twice: First, it becomes
a spreadable paste with tahini, butter, sugar and egg, which becomes
almost halva-like when combined with the cardamom-scented apples.
Second, sesame seeds (and sugar) get sprinkled along the edges of the
tart, making for a strikingly beautiful, textured crust.

Ingredient Substitution Guide

Preparation

1.  Step 1

    For the Dough: Whisk together the flour, sugar and salt in a large
    bowl. Dump in the cold butter and toss until coated in the flour
    mixture, separating any pieces that stick together. Use your fingers
    to smush and flatten each piece once.

2.  Step 2

    Drizzle ¼ cup ice water over the flour mixture. Repeatedly run your
    fingers through the mixture, as if rummaging through a drawer, until
    combined. The dough will start out looking dry then become very
    shaggy. Transfer to a clean work surface and use your palms to knead
    the dough together, forming a ball with no dry spots. You may need
    an additional tablespoon or two of ice water to help the dough come
    together, but even then it will be shaggy, not smooth or shiny.

3.  Step 3

    Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and use your hands to flatten it
    into a round disc about 1-inch thick. Chill for 2 hours or up to 3
    days.

4.  Step 4

    Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour and roll out the dough,
    turning it to prevent it from sticking between rolls, into a 14-inch
    round. Gently gather both ends of the dough and transfer to a
    parchment-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate the dough while you make
    the sesame spread and apple filling.

5.  Step 5

    For the sesame spread: Whisk the tahini, sugar, butter, egg and salt
    together in a medium bowl until smooth. (You can make the sesame
    spread 5 days ahead; just bring to room temperature before using, so
    it spreads easily.)

6.  Step 6

    For the filling: Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Peel, core and thinly
    slice the apples (see Tip). Toss the apple slices, vinegar, sugar
    and the cardamom together in a large bowl until the sugar feels like
    it has dissolved.

7.  Step 7

    Remove the dough from the fridge and plop the sesame spread in the
    center. Use the back of a spoon to evenly distribute the sesame
    spread, leaving a 2-inch border. Arrange the apples on top in
    whatever manner you like. Fold the edges of the dough over the
    apples to form the crust, then brush the dough with heavy cream and
    sprinkle with sesame seeds and more sugar.

8.  Step 8

    Bake on the bottom rack for 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the pan
    halfway through, until the crust is deeply golden brown and the
    apples are tender. Let cool for 20 minutes before slicing and
    serving with the topping of your choice.

Tip

-   One efficient way to peel, core and thinly slice apples is to first
    use a vegetable peeler to remove the peels, starting from the stem
    end and working your way down to the root end. Then, place the
    apples upright and, using a chef's knife, cut each apple around its
    core into three pieces, cutting straight down and slightly rotating
    the apples between cuts. Slice each piece into thin half-moons.

I used only one tablespoon of sugar in the spread, one tablespoon of
sugar in the filling, substituted avocado oil for the butter, and used a
purchased frozen pie shell. It was delicious! I’m going out to the
farmers market to get more apples & make it again.

In the TIP section of the recipe, reference is made to the “root end” of
the apple. Obviously, only the tree itself has roots. The end of the
apple being referenced in the recipe is the “blossom end”, or
“calyx”—the dry remains of the flower.

Fresh tahini isn't bitter. Get a good brand. Whole Foods 365 is good.

Very easy and delicious. I blitzed the dough in a food processor, which
simplified the recipe significantly. Also, make sure to use firm apples
that can handle the cooking, otherwise you're going to get an applesauce
tart. A keeper.

Loved this. Tastes like a restaurant dessert but was so easy to make.
Decidedly not sweet, beautifully spiced. Exactly what I’m looking for in

love the sesame crust. Can’t wait to eat it with coffee tomorrow.

Not too sweet with a nice sesame linger on the tongue. My guests enjoyed
this one with both vanilla and salted caramel ice cream, which really
made the desert perfect. I needed to cook mine in the over for 15
minutes longer to get the nice golden brown crust, but it came out
looking almost like the picture. Will make again and might try using
other nut butters.

I thought this was fantastic. Used a denser golden delicious because the
honeycrisp I had seemed too light and airy and maybe too sweet. I think
they would have been better as my apples did not cook all the way, so I
should have covered the entire top with foil and cooked longer. I used
fresh cardamom from pods and ground with a mortar and pestle. So good,
will definitely make again.

@Cam, if your tahini was bitter it just might be rancid. Once you open
container put in fridge.

I feel like this tart couldn’t decide if it wanted to be sweet or
savory, but it was still quite good. I agree that the tahini made this a
bit bitter. I think next time I’d try almond butter instead. Crust and
apples went fantastic though.

Made this today. A keeper. Nice crust - sesame seeds add flavour. Sliced
apples about 1/8". Next time will do thinner to optimize how I can
arrange the slices - and I plan to sprinkle sugar on the apples as well
as the crust. Bake time is listed as 40-50. I started with 40 - not
golden. Added 10 min to take it to 50. Still not great. Kept going up by
5 minutes and took it out at 70 minutes. Now notice that summary at the
top says the "cook time" is one hour, 30 minutes = 90???

Definitely only needs 4 smaller apples or 3 large ones if you're
planning to insert the slices in a flower formation. I used a mix of
honeycrisp (sweeter) and cosmic crisp (more tart). You may also want to
take out the chilled dough for 10 minutes before you're ready to roll it
out. And if you have a super basic oven like me where things usually
take longer, preheat to 400, drop to 375, and bake for 55-60 minutes.

I think this is my favorite crust ever! I made it as instructed except
using the food processor. So crumbly and buttery!

Birdie2 weeks ago

This turned out very good. I used a storebought rolled pie crust and it
worked just fine. I only needed four apples to fill it though. I also
added a little cinnamon to the apples, since I find cardamom
overpowering on its own. The sesame filling did turn out bitter for me,
so I'm going to see about sourcing a different brand of tahini. The tub
I got was freshly opened. I also had to bake for 15-20 minutes longer.
But all in all this was a neat twist on an old favorite and I will make
it again.

I loved this and would make again for sure. As others have commented,
it’s not super sweet. I used Fuji apples, medium sized, I packed them in
a tight spiral (almost standing them up in the sticky filling) and used
about 4.5 apples). In hindsight I suppose I could have made more flat
layers to fit in more, but this result was great. Baked around 65
minutes to match the golden hue of the photo. Filling was perfect,
pastry was on the crunchy side.

I used a mandolin to slice, and did not peel the apples. Would do the
same way next time! Easy, and I like the look.

I started with 4 apples, with the option for more but decided that was
sufficient for my dough. Cook time ended up at around an hour, but as
always this will depend on your oven, your nose and your preferences.
This is a winner in my house: the crust shattered beautifully, the
sesame was present but not overpowering and the cardamom was delightful.
Will absolutely make again.

These are some of my favorite ingredients, but the tahini and cardamon
don't come together for me in this dish. They almost cancel each other
out! I'm dismayed but there it is. Trust me, I really wanted to like
this, and I tried twice: first with Honeycrisp apples, and second with
Cosmic Crisp apples and extra demerera sugar on top. The crust was
tasty, and I liked that with the tahini part. I might simply bake that,
cool it, and fill it with custard and blackberries.

stacy in the desert4 weeks ago

I use gf crust for pies. Used a store-bought version and should have par
baked it first. The crust was soggy from the tahini butter. A 9” pie
crust is a little small for 2lbs of apples. But the flavor was sublime!
I’m not a big cinnamon fan so the tahini butter and cardamom were
perfect with the apples. Next attempt will be with homemade gf tart
shell that is par-baked.

Tony4 weeks ago

It was different, which was good. Not a lot of added sugar was a plus
too. I made it in a deep dish pie plate which contained the apples
better. It needed more like 70 minutes to bake, both to brown the crust
and for the apples to soften enough. Maybe needed more spices, cinnamon
and ginger, to go with less cardamom which otherwise was a little
overpowering.

6 apples is way too many to put in this tart. I did end up adding more
water, but I’m making this in October and the environmental humidity
genuinely may play a role in that. I recommend fresh grinding cardamom
seeds from cardamom pods. It makes a large (beneficial) difference in
flavor

Did anyone else have a big problem with too much apple juice flooding

Morgan Smith1 month ago

This is not a good recipe - though I love the idea and flavor combos.
First, after baking, the dough turned into a liquid mess and looks
completely unappetizing. Second, 6 apples is FAR too many and felt
wasteful. I would suggest the author make some edits, as it seems a lot
of folks have had issues.

Coring the apples1 month ago

The multiple methods of curing apples with just a knife make me wonder
why more people don't have a simple hand apple corer. They really speed
up cutting shoes and remove the minimum of flesh.

Mine is still in the oven, but it is clear this recipe needs editing in
three (and maybe 4) places. (1) recipe never says whether this is a
free-form tart, or is intended for a shallow tart pan, or is so big it
should go in a real pie pan. (2) two lbs of apples is over-generous.
Many commenters ended up with too many for their pans and mine are piled
waaay crazy high. (3) Expected cook time at top of page says 1.5 hrs,
text says 40-50, and several commenters had to cook much longer. (4)
Given the # of comments re leaking, maybe some thickener is needed.
