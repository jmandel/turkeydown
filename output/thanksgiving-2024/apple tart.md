  "description": "If you’re someone who loves a dessert packed with fruit and texture, this apple tart is made for you. The double dose of sesame is used in both the crust and filling, giving a nutty, earthy pop against the natural sweetness of the apples. They get tossed in ground cardamom for a wonderfully sweet, warm scent. Sesame is used twice: First, it becomes a spreadable paste with tahini, butter, sugar and egg, which becomes almost halva-like when combined with the cardamom-scented apples. Second, sesame seeds (and sugar) get sprinkled along the edges of the tart, making for a strikingly beautiful, textured crust. ",

And if you have a super basic oven like me where things usually take longer, preheat to 400, drop to 375, and bake for 55-60 minutes.",

I also added a little cinnamon to the apples, since I find cardamom overpowering on its own. The sesame filling did turn out bitter for me, so I'm going to see about sourcing a different brand of tahini. The tub I got was freshly opened. I also had to bake for 15-20 minutes longer. But all in all this was a neat twist on an old favorite and I will make it again.",

In hindsight I suppose I could have made more flat layers to fit in more, but this result was great. \nBaked around 65 minutes to match the golden hue of the photo.

Tahini Apple Tart

If you’re someone who loves a dessert packed with fruit and texture,
this apple tart is made for you. The double dose of sesame is used in
both the crust and filling, giving a nutty, earthy pop against the
natural sweetness of the apples. They get tossed in ground cardamom for
a wonderfully sweet, warm scent. Sesame is used twice: First, it becomes
a spreadable paste with tahini, butter, sugar and egg, which becomes
almost halva-like when combined with the cardamom-scented apples.
Second, sesame seeds (and sugar) get sprinkled along the edges of the
tart, making for a strikingly beautiful, textured crust.

Ingredient Substitution Guide

Preparation

1.  Step 1

    For the Dough: Whisk together the flour, sugar and salt in a large
    bowl. Dump in the cold butter and toss until coated in the flour
    mixture, separating any pieces that stick together. Use your fingers
    to smush and flatten each piece once.

2.  Step 2

    Drizzle ¼ cup ice water over the flour mixture. Repeatedly run your
    fingers through the mixture, as if rummaging through a drawer, until
    combined. The dough will start out looking dry then become very
    shaggy. Transfer to a clean work surface and use your palms to knead
    the dough together, forming a ball with no dry spots. You may need
    an additional tablespoon or two of ice water to help the dough come
    together, but even then it will be shaggy, not smooth or shiny.

3.  Step 3

    Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and use your hands to flatten it
    into a round disc about 1-inch thick. Chill for 2 hours or up to 3
    days.

4.  Step 4

    Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour and roll out the dough,
    turning it to prevent it from sticking between rolls, into a 14-inch
    round. Gently gather both ends of the dough and transfer to a
    parchment-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate the dough while you make
    the sesame spread and apple filling.

5.  Step 5

    For the sesame spread: Whisk the tahini, sugar, butter, egg and salt
    together in a medium bowl until smooth. (You can make the sesame
    spread 5 days ahead; just bring to room temperature before using, so
    it spreads easily.)

6.  Step 6

    For the filling: Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Peel, core and thinly
    slice the apples (see Tip). Toss the apple slices, vinegar, sugar
    and the cardamom together in a large bowl until the sugar feels like
    it has dissolved.

7.  Step 7

    Remove the dough from the fridge and plop the sesame spread in the
    center. Use the back of a spoon to evenly distribute the sesame
    spread, leaving a 2-inch border. Arrange the apples on top in
    whatever manner you like. Fold the edges of the dough over the
    apples to form the crust, then brush the dough with heavy cream and
    sprinkle with sesame seeds and more sugar.

8.  Step 8

    Bake on the bottom rack for 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the pan
    halfway through, until the crust is deeply golden brown and the
    apples are tender. Let cool for 20 minutes before slicing and
    serving with the topping of your choice.

Tip

-   One efficient way to peel, core and thinly slice apples is to first
    use a vegetable peeler to remove the peels, starting from the stem
    end and working your way down to the root end. Then, place the
    apples upright and, using a chef's knife, cut each apple around its
    core into three pieces, cutting straight down and slightly rotating
    the apples between cuts. Slice each piece into thin half-moons.

I used only one tablespoon of sugar in the spread, one tablespoon of
sugar in the filling, substituted avocado oil for the butter, and used a
purchased frozen pie shell. It was delicious! I’m going out to the
farmers market to get more apples & make it again.

In the TIP section of the recipe, reference is made to the “root end” of
the apple. Obviously, only the tree itself has roots. The end of the
apple being referenced in the recipe is the “blossom end”, or
“calyx”—the dry remains of the flower.

Fresh tahini isn't bitter. Get a good brand. Whole Foods 365 is good.

Very easy and delicious. I blitzed the dough in a food processor, which
simplified the recipe significantly. Also, make sure to use firm apples
that can handle the cooking, otherwise you're going to get an applesauce
tart. A keeper.

Loved this. Tastes like a restaurant dessert but was so easy to make.
Decidedly not sweet, beautifully spiced. Exactly what I’m looking for in

love the sesame crust. Can’t wait to eat it with coffee tomorrow.

Not too sweet with a nice sesame linger on the tongue. My guests enjoyed
this one with both vanilla and salted caramel ice cream, which really
made the desert perfect. I needed to cook mine in the over for 15
minutes longer to get the nice golden brown crust, but it came out
looking almost like the picture. Will make again and might try using
other nut butters.

I thought this was fantastic. Used a denser golden delicious because the
honeycrisp I had seemed too light and airy and maybe too sweet. I think
they would have been better as my apples did not cook all the way, so I
should have covered the entire top with foil and cooked longer. I used
fresh cardamom from pods and ground with a mortar and pestle. So good,
will definitely make again.

@Cam, if your tahini was bitter it just might be rancid. Once you open
container put in fridge.

I feel like this tart couldn’t decide if it wanted to be sweet or
savory, but it was still quite good. I agree that the tahini made this a
bit bitter. I think next time I’d try almond butter instead. Crust and
apples went fantastic though.

Made this today. A keeper. Nice crust - sesame seeds add flavour. Sliced
apples about 1/8". Next time will do thinner to optimize how I can
arrange the slices - and I plan to sprinkle sugar on the apples as well
as the crust. Bake time is listed as 40-50. I started with 40 - not
golden. Added 10 min to take it to 50. Still not great. Kept going up by
5 minutes and took it out at 70 minutes. Now notice that summary at the
top says the "cook time" is one hour, 30 minutes = 90???

Definitely only needs 4 smaller apples or 3 large ones if you're
planning to insert the slices in a flower formation. I used a mix of
honeycrisp (sweeter) and cosmic crisp (more tart). You may also want to
take out the chilled dough for 10 minutes before you're ready to roll it
out. And if you have a super basic oven like me where things usually
take longer, preheat to 400, drop to 375, and bake for 55-60 minutes.

I think this is my favorite crust ever! I made it as instructed except
using the food processor. So crumbly and buttery!

Birdie2 weeks ago

This turned out very good. I used a storebought rolled pie crust and it
worked just fine. I only needed four apples to fill it though. I also
added a little cinnamon to the apples, since I find cardamom
overpowering on its own. The sesame filling did turn out bitter for me,
so I'm going to see about sourcing a different brand of tahini. The tub
I got was freshly opened. I also had to bake for 15-20 minutes longer.
But all in all this was a neat twist on an old favorite and I will make
it again.

I loved this and would make again for sure. As others have commented,
it’s not super sweet. I used Fuji apples, medium sized, I packed them in
a tight spiral (almost standing them up in the sticky filling) and used
about 4.5 apples). In hindsight I suppose I could have made more flat
layers to fit in more, but this result was great. Baked around 65
minutes to match the golden hue of the photo. Filling was perfect,
pastry was on the crunchy side.

I used a mandolin to slice, and did not peel the apples. Would do the
same way next time! Easy, and I like the look.

I started with 4 apples, with the option for more but decided that was
sufficient for my dough. Cook time ended up at around an hour, but as
always this will depend on your oven, your nose and your preferences.
This is a winner in my house: the crust shattered beautifully, the
sesame was present but not overpowering and the cardamom was delightful.
Will absolutely make again.

These are some of my favorite ingredients, but the tahini and cardamon
don't come together for me in this dish. They almost cancel each other
out! I'm dismayed but there it is. Trust me, I really wanted to like
this, and I tried twice: first with Honeycrisp apples, and second with
Cosmic Crisp apples and extra demerera sugar on top. The crust was
tasty, and I liked that with the tahini part. I might simply bake that,
cool it, and fill it with custard and blackberries.

stacy in the desert4 weeks ago

I use gf crust for pies. Used a store-bought version and should have par
baked it first. The crust was soggy from the tahini butter. A 9” pie
crust is a little small for 2lbs of apples. But the flavor was sublime!
I’m not a big cinnamon fan so the tahini butter and cardamom were
perfect with the apples. Next attempt will be with homemade gf tart
shell that is par-baked.

Tony4 weeks ago

It was different, which was good. Not a lot of added sugar was a plus
too. I made it in a deep dish pie plate which contained the apples
better. It needed more like 70 minutes to bake, both to brown the crust
and for the apples to soften enough. Maybe needed more spices, cinnamon
and ginger, to go with less cardamom which otherwise was a little
overpowering.

6 apples is way too many to put in this tart. I did end up adding more
water, but I’m making this in October and the environmental humidity
genuinely may play a role in that. I recommend fresh grinding cardamom
seeds from cardamom pods. It makes a large (beneficial) difference in
flavor

Did anyone else have a big problem with too much apple juice flooding

Morgan Smith1 month ago

This is not a good recipe - though I love the idea and flavor combos.
First, after baking, the dough turned into a liquid mess and looks
completely unappetizing. Second, 6 apples is FAR too many and felt
wasteful. I would suggest the author make some edits, as it seems a lot
of folks have had issues.

Coring the apples1 month ago

The multiple methods of curing apples with just a knife make me wonder
why more people don't have a simple hand apple corer. They really speed
up cutting shoes and remove the minimum of flesh.

Mine is still in the oven, but it is clear this recipe needs editing in
three (and maybe 4) places. (1) recipe never says whether this is a
free-form tart, or is intended for a shallow tart pan, or is so big it
should go in a real pie pan. (2) two lbs of apples is over-generous.
Many commenters ended up with too many for their pans and mine are piled
waaay crazy high. (3) Expected cook time at top of page says 1.5 hrs,
text says 40-50, and several commenters had to cook much longer. (4)
Given the # of comments re leaking, maybe some thickener is needed.

The double dose of sesame is used in both the crust and filling, giving a nutty, earthy pop against the natural sweetness of the apples. They get tossed in ground cardamom for a wonderfully sweet, warm scent. Sesame is used twice: First, it becomes a spreadable paste with tahini, butter, sugar and egg, which becomes almost halva-like when combined with the cardamom-scented apples. Second, sesame seeds (and sugar) get sprinkled along the edges of the tart, making for a strikingly beautiful, textured crust. \",\n  \"author\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Person\",\n    \"name\": \"Andy Baraghani\"\n  },\n  \"image\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-square640.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-square640.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 640,\n      \"width\": 640,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-googleFourByThree.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-googleFourByThree.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 600,\n      \"width\": 800,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-videoSmall.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-videoSmall.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 281,\n      \"width\": 500,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 1103,\n      \"width\": 735,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"prepTime\": \"PT40M\",\n  \"cookTime\": \"PT1H30M\",\n  \"totalTime\": \"PT2H10M\",\n  \"recipeYield\": \"8 servings\",\n  \"recipeCuisine\": \"\",\n  \"recipeCategory\": \"dessert\",\n  \"keywords\": \"apple, cardamom, make-ahead, plan-ahead, sesame seed, tahini, tart, fall, thanksgiving\",\n  \"aggregateRating\": {\n    \"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n    \"ratingValue\": 5,\n    \"ratingCount\": 383\n  },\n  \"recipeIngredient\": [\n    \"1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed \",\n    \"1 tablespoon sugar\",\n    \"1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)\",\n    \"3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter, cut into small cubes, chilled \",\n    \"Ice water, as needed\",\n    \"1/3 cup tahini\",\n    \"3 tablespoons sugar \",\n    \"3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature \",\n    \"1 large egg\",\n    \"1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\",\n    \"2 pounds crisp, tart apples such as Honeycrisp or Pink Lady (about 6 medium apples) \",\n    \"1 tablespoon cider vinegar or lemon juice\",\n    \"3 tablespoons sugar, plus more for sprinkling \",\n    \"1 teaspoon ground cardamom\",\n    \"Heavy cream, for brushing \",\n    \"1 to 2 tablespoons white sesame seeds \",\n    \"Vanilla ice cream, whipped cream or crème fraîche, for serving\"\n  ],\n  \"recipeInstructions\": [\n    {\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"HowToStep\",\n      \"text\": \"For the Dough: Whisk together the flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl.

But all in all this was a neat twist on an old favorite and I will make it again.\",\n      \"datePublished\": \"2024-11-09T23:47:52.000Z\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Review\",\n      \"author\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Person\",\n        \"name\": \"OB\"\n      },\n      \"reviewBody\": \"I loved this and would make again for sure. \\nAs others have commented, it’s not super sweet. \\nI used Fuji apples, medium sized, I packed them in a tight spiral (almost standing them up in the sticky filling) and used about 4.5 apples).

Food Stylist: Barrett Washburne.\n\nTotal Time\n    2 hours 10 minutes, plus 2 hours’ chilling\n\nPrep Time\n    40 minutes\n\nCook Time\n    1 hour and 30 minutes, plus 2 hours’ chilling\n\nRating\n    5[][][][][](383)\n\nNotes\n    Read community notes[]\n\nIf you’re someone who loves a dessert packed with fruit and texture,\nthis apple tart is made for you. The double dose of sesame is used in\nboth the crust and filling, giving a nutty, earthy pop against the\nnatural sweetness of the apples. They get tossed in ground cardamom for\na wonderfully sweet, warm scent. Sesame is used twice: First, it becomes\na spreadable paste with tahini, butter, sugar and egg, which becomes\nalmost halva-like when combined with the cardamom-scented apples.\nSecond, sesame seeds (and sugar) get sprinkled along the edges of the\ntart, making for a strikingly beautiful, textured crust. \n\nRead More\n\n-   []Save\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   []Give\n    Subscriber benefit: give recipes to anyone\n\n    As a subscriber, you have 10 gift recipes to give each month.

Step 1\n\n    For the Dough: Whisk together the flour, sugar and salt in a large\n    bowl. Dump in the cold butter and toss until coated in the flour\n    mixture, separating any pieces that stick together. Use your fingers\n    to smush and flatten each piece once.\n\n2.  Step 2\n\n    Drizzle ¼ cup ice water over the flour mixture. Repeatedly run your\n    fingers through the mixture, as if rummaging through a drawer, until\n    combined. The dough will start out looking dry then become very\n    shaggy. Transfer to a clean work surface and use your palms to knead\n    the dough together, forming a ball with no dry spots. You may need\n    an additional tablespoon or two of ice water to help the dough come\n    together, but even then it will be shaggy, not smooth or shiny.\n\n3.  Step 3\n\n    Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and use your hands to flatten it\n    into a round disc about 1-inch thick. Chill for 2 hours or up to 3\n    days.\n\n4.  Step 4\n\n    Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour and roll out the dough,\n    turning it to prevent it from sticking between rolls, into a 14-inch\n    round. Gently gather both ends of the dough and transfer to a\n    parchment-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate the dough while you make\n    the sesame spread and apple filling.\n\n5.  Step 5\n\n    For the sesame spread: Whisk the tahini, sugar, butter, egg and salt\n    together in a medium bowl until smooth. (You can make the sesame\n    spread 5 days ahead; just bring to room temperature before using, so\n    it spreads easily.)\n\n6.  Step 6\n\n    For the filling: Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Peel, core and thinly\n    slice the apples (see Tip). Toss the apple slices, vinegar, sugar\n    and the cardamom together in a large bowl until the sugar feels like\n    it has dissolved.\n\n7.  Step 7\n\n    Remove the dough from the fridge and plop the sesame spread in the\n    center. Use the back of a spoon to evenly distribute the sesame\n    spread, leaving a 2-inch border. Arrange the apples on top in\n    whatever manner you like. Fold the edges of the dough over the\n    apples to form the crust, then brush the dough with heavy cream and\n    sprinkle with sesame seeds and more sugar.\n\n8.  Step 8\n\n    Bake on the bottom rack for 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the pan\n    halfway through, until the crust is deeply golden brown and the\n    apples are tender. Let cool for 20 minutes before slicing and\n    serving with the topping of your choice.\n\nTip\n\n-   One efficient way to peel, core and thinly slice apples is to first\n    use a vegetable peeler to remove the peels, starting from the stem\n    end and working your way down to the root end. Then, place the\n    apples upright and, using a chef's knife, cut each apple around its\n    core into three pieces, cutting straight down and slightly rotating\n    the apples between cuts. Slice each piece into thin half-moons.\n\nSimilar Recipes\n\n[]\n\n-   \n    [Sticky Miso Salmon Bowl]\n\n    Sticky Miso Salmon Bowl\n\n    Andy Baraghani\n-   \n    [Maple-Roasted Squash With Charred Lemon]\n\n    Maple-Roasted Squash With Charred Lemon\n\n    Melissa Clark\n-   \n    [Brown Sugar Layer Cake With Cranberry Buttercream]\n\n    Brown Sugar Layer Cake With Cranberry Buttercream\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Nam Prik Ong Lasagna]\n\n    Nam Prik Ong Lasagna\n\n    Khushbu Shah\n-   \n    [Baked Apple Cider Doughnuts]\n\n    Baked Apple Cider Doughnuts\n\n    Erin Jeanne McDowell\n-   \n    [Laminated Pie Dough]\n\n    Laminated Pie Dough\n\n    Vaughn Vreeland\n-   \n    [Butter Swim Biscuits]\n\n    Butter Swim Biscuits\n\n    Naz Deravian\n-   \n    [Potatoes Romanoff]\n\n    Potatoes Romanoff\n\n    Naz Deravian\n-   \n    [Chewy Brownie Cookies]\n\n    Chewy Brownie Cookies\n\n    Vaughn Vreeland\n-   \n    [Christina Tosi’s Corn Bake]\n\n    Christina Tosi’s Corn Bake\n\n    Christina Tosi\n-   \n    [Best Black Bean Soup]\n\n    Best Black Bean Soup\n\n    Julia Moskin\n-   \n    [Spice Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting]\n\n    Spice Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Braised White Beans and Greens With Parmesan]\n\n    Braised White Beans and Greens With Parmesan\n\n    Lidey Heuck\n-   \n    [Ras el Hanout Roasted Vegetables]\n\n    Ras el Hanout Roasted Vegetables\n\n    Nargisse Benkabbou\n-   \n    [Saag Paneer Lasagna]\n\n    Saag Paneer Lasagna\n\n    Khushbu Shah\n-   \n    [Giant Roasted Vegetable Platter]\n\n    Giant Roasted Vegetable Platter\n\n    Melissa Clark\n-   \n    [Cheese Dreams]\n\n    Cheese Dreams\n\n    Melissa Knific\n-   \n    [Butternut Squash Sambar]\n\n    Butternut Squash Sambar\n\n    Naz Deravian\n-   \n    [All-Purpose Biscuits]\n\n    All-Purpose Biscuits\n\n    Sam Sifton\n-   \n    [Loaded Baked Sweet Potatoes]\n\n    Loaded Baked Sweet Potatoes\n\n    Lidey Heuck\n\n[]\n\nRatings\n\n[]\n\n5 out of 5\n\n383 user ratings\n\nYour rating\n\n1 star[]2 stars[]3 stars[]4 stars[]5 stars[]\n\nSubmit\n\nLog in or sign up to rate this recipe.\n\nHave you cooked this?\n\n[]Mark as Cooked\n\nLog in or sign up to mark this recipe as cooked.\n\nPrivate Notes\n\nLeave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.\n\nCooking Notes\n\nAdd Note\n\nPublicPrivate\n\nSubmit\n\n-   All Notes\n-   Private\n\nJudy2 months ago\n\nI used only one tablespoon of sugar in the spread, one tablespoon of\nsugar in the filling, substituted avocado oil for the butter, and used a\npurchased frozen pie shell.

Used a denser golden delicious because the\nhoneycrisp I had seemed too light and airy and maybe too sweet. I think\nthey would have been better as my apples did not cook all the way, so I\nshould have covered the entire top with foil and cooked longer. I used\nfresh cardamom from pods and ground with a mortar and pestle. So good,\nwill definitely make again.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 26\n\nSandy1 month ago\n\n@Cam, if your tahini was bitter it just might be rancid.

A keeper. Nice crust - sesame seeds add flavour. Sliced\napples about 1/8\". Next time will do thinner to optimize how I can\narrange the slices - and I plan to sprinkle sugar on the apples as well\nas the crust. Bake time is listed as 40-50. I started with 40 - not\ngolden. Added 10 min to take it to 50. Still not great. Kept going up by\n5 minutes and took it out at 70 minutes. Now notice that summary at the\ntop says the \"cook time\" is one hour, 30 minutes = 90???\n\nIs this helpful?[] 10\n\nLore Dowell1 week ago\n\nSo the pie is not baked in a pie dish?\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nShawn1 week ago\n\nDefinitely only needs 4 smaller apples or 3 large ones if you're\nplanning to insert the slices in a flower formation. I used a mix of\nhoneycrisp (sweeter) and cosmic crisp (more tart). You may also want to\ntake out the chilled dough for 10 minutes before you're ready to roll it\nout. And if you have a super basic oven like me where things usually\ntake longer, preheat to 400, drop to 375, and bake for 55-60 minutes.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nML1 week ago\n\nI think this is my favorite crust ever! I made it as instructed except\nusing the food processor. So crumbly and buttery!\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nBirdie2 weeks ago\n\nThis turned out very good. I used a storebought rolled pie crust and it\nworked just fine. I only needed four apples to fill it though. I also\nadded a little cinnamon to the apples, since I find cardamom\noverpowering on its own. The sesame filling did turn out bitter for me,\nso I'm going to see about sourcing a different brand of tahini. The tub\nI got was freshly opened. I also had to bake for 15-20 minutes longer.\nBut all in all this was a neat twist on an old favorite and I will make\nit again.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nOB3 weeks ago\n\nI loved this and would make again for sure. As others have commented,\nit’s not super sweet. I used Fuji apples, medium sized, I packed them in\na tight spiral (almost standing them up in the sticky filling) and used\nabout 4.5 apples). In hindsight I suppose I could have made more flat\nlayers to fit in more, but this result was great. Baked around 65\nminutes to match the golden hue of the photo. Filling was perfect,\npastry was on the crunchy side.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nOB3 weeks ago\n\nI used a mandolin to slice, and did not peel the apples. Would do the\nsame way next time! Easy, and I like the look.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nKeri3 weeks ago\n\nI started with 4 apples, with the option for more but decided that was\nsufficient for my dough. Cook time ended up at around an hour, but as\nalways this will depend on your oven, your nose and your preferences.\nThis is a winner in my house: the crust shattered beautifully, the\nsesame was present but not overpowering and the cardamom was delightful.\nWill absolutely make again.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nAnna3 weeks ago\n\nThese are some of my favorite ingredients, but the tahini and cardamon\ndon't come together for me in this dish. They almost cancel each other\nout! I'm dismayed but there it is. Trust me, I really wanted to like\nthis, and I tried twice: first with Honeycrisp apples, and second with\nCosmic Crisp apples and extra demerera sugar on top. The crust was\ntasty, and I liked that with the tahini part. I might simply bake that,\ncool it, and fill it with custard and blackberries.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nstacy in the desert4 weeks ago\n\nI use gf crust for pies. Used a store-bought version and should have par\nbaked it first. The crust was soggy from the tahini butter. A 9” pie\ncrust is a little small for 2lbs of apples. But the flavor was sublime!\nI’m not a big cinnamon fan so the tahini butter and cardamom were\nperfect with the apples. Next attempt will be with homemade gf tart\nshell that is par-baked.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nTony4 weeks ago\n\nIt was different, which was good. Not a lot of added sugar was a plus\ntoo. I made it in a deep dish pie plate which contained the apples\nbetter. It needed more like 70 minutes to bake, both to brown the crust\nand for the apples to soften enough. Maybe needed more spices, cinnamon\nand ginger, to go with less cardamom which otherwise was a little\noverpowering.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nAsia1 month ago\n\n6 apples is way too many to put in this tart. I did end up adding more\nwater, but I’m making this in October and the environmental humidity\ngenuinely may play a role in that. I recommend fresh grinding cardamom\nseeds from cardamom pods.

(2) two lbs of apples is over-generous.\nMany commenters ended up with too many for their pans and mine are piled\nwaaay crazy high. (3) Expected cook time at top of page says 1.5 hrs,\ntext says 40-50, and several commenters had to cook much longer.
