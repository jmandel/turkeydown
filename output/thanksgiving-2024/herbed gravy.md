Here's a recipe for Classic Turkey Gravy with Fresh Herbs:

Ingredients:
- Pan drippings from roasted turkey
- 4 cups turkey or chicken stock
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup butter (if needed)
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
- 2 tablespoons fresh sage, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped
- Salt and black pepper to taste

Instructions:
1. After roasting turkey, pour pan drippings into a fat separator or large bowl.

2. Skim fat from drippings, reserving 1/2 cup of fat. If you don't have enough fat, add butter to reach 1/2 cup.

3. In a large saucepan over medium heat, add reserved fat.

4. Whisk in flour and cook for 2-3 minutes to make a roux, stirring constantly.

5. Gradually whisk in reserved turkey drippings and stock.

6. Add fresh herbs.

7. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until gravy thickens (about 10-15 minutes).

8. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

9. Strain if desired for smoother gravy.

10. Serve hot.

Tips:
- Make sure to scrape up the browned bits from the roasting pan
- For extra richness, add a splash of white wine
- Store leftovers in refrigerator for up to 4 days
