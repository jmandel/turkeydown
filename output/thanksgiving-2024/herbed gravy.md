# Herbed Gravy

Here's a recipe for classic turkey gravy with fresh herbs:

Ingredients:
- Pan drippings from roasted turkey
- 4 cups turkey or chicken stock
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
- 2 tablespoons fresh sage, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped
- Salt and black pepper to taste

Instructions:
1. After roasting turkey, pour pan drippings into a fat separator or remove excess fat with a spoon.

2. In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.

3. Add flour and whisk constantly for 2-3 minutes to make a roux.

4. Gradually add turkey drippings and stock while whisking continuously to prevent lumps.

5. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until thickened.

6. Add fresh herbs and continue cooking for 2-3 minutes.

7. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

8. Strain if desired for a smoother consistency.

Serve hot over turkey, mashed potatoes, or stuffing.

Tips:

- Keep warm in a covered container until ready to serve
