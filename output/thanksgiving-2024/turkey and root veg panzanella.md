The only thing I don’t do anymore is cook it one the oven rack and let it drip over the vegetables.  While it was delicious, it is also very messy in the oven and so now I skip the panzanella and cook the turkey on a roasting rack and pan.  I gather the drippings and add to my roasted root vegetables that way.  The brining makes all the difference for a well flavored and very moist turkey.  It was so enjoyed that there were very little leftovers yams I had to share this recipe to all our guests."

I lined this pan with foil shaped to funnel juices into the pan bottom and put about 2 cups of stock under to I could make gravy.<br /><br />This will be my go to method for whole poultry roasting!"

In my local Trader Joe's, they only sell parsnips and rutabagas in 1 lb bags, so I went with 1 lb each of parsnips, rutabagas, and carrots. For bread, I just used a Costco baguette, and that was OK, but I'd probably put a little more thought into the bread next time.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>It does create a bit of smoke, but my wife is Chinese, so a little smoke in the kitchen didn't freak her out. I turned the kitchen fan on full blast as soon as I put the turkey in the oven. I put the veggies on a cookie sheet, and I made some tinfoil extenders for the sides of the cookie sheet to catch more of the drippings. I think that helped to keep the smoke down to something reasonable.</div><div><br /></div><div>Try it. I guarantee that you'll _love_ it!</div><div><br /></div>"

In 30 years of putting on Tgiving feasts, I'd never confronted such a disaster.  Not this time.  I cut up the bird, nuked one breast (after separating the skin), and cooked the remainder for another 45 mins.  (Not quite the payoff for living with roadkill in the fridge for four days!)"

This was a 17lb bird.<br />I do have an odd large flat pan but I think a jelly roll pan might work. I line it with foil and parchment first and use my regular stuffing recipe. Put the rack going head to tail across the short side of the pan, you shouldn't have to much hanging over, cut your foil a little longer to catch the drippings. After about 30 min. take out the parchment with your stuffing and move it to a casserole to finish baking to the right temp. Put the turkey back in to finish cooking.<br />You get a gorgeous bird, moist, easy to cut and real stuffing with drippings. Gravy made with back,neck &amp; drippings from pan"

You were all a great help.  <br /><br />Here's what I did:  I dry-brined my 13.5 lb fresh turkey for 4 days, had all ingredients except for the all spice berries.  When I baked it, I put the turkey on a cooling rack on top of my baking sheet and lined my oven with oven liner.  425 degrees @  30 minutes, down to 350 @ 60 minutes.  I checked doneness at 350 @ 45 minutes and it was at 155 but looked undone so I added 15 more minutes and temp was up to 165 and was cooked through.  I covered the turkey and let it rest.  The wings had a nice and crispy skin as did the breast but the legs were not that crispy.  Best of all, no basting needed.  This was the least hassle turkey meal I have ever made. <br /><br />I did not make the panzanella because just looking at the ingredients -- my kids would never have touched it so I did not bother.  <br />"

I didn't like putting the turkey on the oven rack so I used my broiler pan which I did not preheat.  I put the broiler pan on top of the stone to cook.<br /><br />All of a sudden the temp probe read 160 - after only 75 minutes total cooking time.

Thank goodness I had heard Alton on NPR referring to this method in a program a few days ago. While I washed the bird, husband was dispatched to write down the specifics and bring them to me in the kitchen. <br />Well, I put the extra breast in the drippings pan instead of vegetables since I was only concerned about taking a turkey to the feast. It worked beautifully and despite not having brined the turkey at all, it was the moistest turkey I have ever had. I make a good turkey, usually, but this was phenomenal!<br />"

It was 18 pounds, so I doubled the dry brine ingredients and just slathered them on until they looked even around the bird.  I didn't think it was too salty, as some have said.  Maybe the store bought turkeys that are already injected with salt need less in the brine?  It also took 38 minutes longer to cook due to the size, but I expected that and planned for it. <br /> - I thought the panzanella was great, and added a really nice slight acid to the often one-note of the Thanksgiving plate. It DEFINITELY prevented the smokey kitchen, so roast some kind of veggies in the bottom.<br />- We have a second refrigerator and a large stove.

If you use Morton's, go 2 Tbsp per 14 lb bird.<br /><br />- Our 19 lb bird took a lot longer.<br /><br />- Pull at 160 deg F if you need more doneness. We pulled around 155, resting took care of pink.<br /><br />- The rack procedure is tricky if you have a bigger bird or aren't doing the panzanella. We did have to alter a bit due to smoke. Just make a nice big/wide leak-proof rig to catch the fat, maybe with a mirepoix.<br /><br />- Concept of this turkey can be applied to chicken. I'll definitely try it."

So I threw it back in the pan and roasted it for another 20 minutes to burn off some of the vinegar and it was awesome.  No leftovers.

      "reviewBody": "I walked into my house where my wife has been cooking this recipe, and was greeted with the stench of burnt grease.  How on earth are you supposed to roast a turkey directly on the rack, without grease dripping off to the side everywhere?  Does Alton own a giant oven that normal people don't own?  Our 13 lb bird was dripping everywhere but the pan beneath it,  God help anyone trying to cook a 20 lb. turkey.  Instead of the smell of Thanksgiving, our house reeks of burnt grease."

      "reviewBody": "Most amazing turkey ever!! I ran into several issues (not having anything to do with the recipe and it still worked out! I had an 18 lb turkey and THEN looked for recipes. I found this one, quickly defrosted the turkey days earlier than intended, wrestled into its more or less flattened, butterflied shape and left to age with the dry rub in the fridge for days. It looked a little weird by day four, but no matter! The second problem I ran into was my digital thermometer BROKE and it was too late to get another one so I had to guess at timing and doneness the old fashioned way. As a result I'm pretty sure I could have taken the turkey out at least 30 minutes earlier than I did BUT it was still amazing!!! Tasty, moist, crispy skin. My grown up kids and I were practically swooning from tasting bits before it even got to the table. Every year we love the turkey we make better than the last but this is THE one that we'll make from now on."

We cooked the turkey directly on the racks, as directed, which does make a mess, but my sister-in-law had a good cleanup tip: slide the oven racks in a large garbage bag, put a cup of ammonia in a soup can, set the can in the bag with the racks, seal tightly and leave on the garage floor (cool concrete overnight. The racks cleaned up really easily the next morning. Rather than the veggies, we baked the stuffing in pans under the turkey.  VERY good. Definitely using this method again."

      "reviewBody": "This turkey recipe was great.  I made two 14 lbs birds for my family of 23, they brought the sides.  One bird was cooked the traditional way of brining for 24 hours in water.  But for the other, a much cheaper store brand turkey, I followed this recipe, dry brined and allowed it to dry in frig for 4 days.  My family loved it.  We cut the bird and transferred to the serving platter and while I had my back turned family members had picked the carcass clean.  The traditional bird was still good, but lots was left over.  The dry brined bird was gone.  Raves all around.<br /><br />I didn't make the panzanella.  I put a disposable heavy aluminum tray on the rack under the bird to catch the droppings.  The droppings were very salty.  I added low salt broth to the gravy to decrease the salt.<br /><br />I loved preparing the bird on Sunday for Thanksgiving.  It made the holiday less stressful for me.   "

The panzanella was also great, though it didn't seem like that many juices drained from the bird.<br /><br />Couple of suggestions: (1 put a sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil under the pan to catch any stray drippings. (2 cook the bird on a half sheet pan cooling rack instead of directly on the oven rack so that it's easier to get out (and also doesn't coat the oven rack with turkey fat."

This was my last shot at keeping the turkey in our Thanksgiving feasts...he prefers ham, which I prefer to have at Christmas. But he agreed to give this recipe a go. We ALL loved, loved, loved it!! The meat was so moist and flavorful, the skin nice and crisp. We also loved the panzanella (my husband also hates brussel sprouts, but had second helpings of this. Thanks to you and this recipe, turkey will be heartily welcomed for many years to come. "

This year I was determined to try his swan song Thanksgiving recipe. <br /><br />I'll be honest, I was super scared of this. It didn't make any sense that the turkey could hold onto moisture if there was t any water to introduce. But AB hadn't ever let me down, so I forged ahead. And everyday as I gazed at my turkey I had to steal myself for the possibility of turkey jerkey. The turkey looked frighteningly dry as it roosted in the fridge. <br /><br />But when I carved that thing it was hands down the most delicious, flavorful, moist turkey I've ever made. I'll never experiment again. Nor will I ever doubt AB's science. "

I was almost full just from my inability to avoid temptation when carving. Now it's Easter and we are doing again for family.

For starters, all the prep work is done says in advance, and there is no messy, heavy brine juice to deal with.  I also used the backbone and neck to make stock ahead of time for gravy and stuffing, rather than having to use box broth or make chicken stock.  I took the bird out whan AB said, however the temp did not rise enough and I had to put the bird back in for a bit.  I agree with the other reviewers who said to leave the bird in for a few more degrees...  This was still the juiciest, most flavorful turkey I have ever eaten.  This review is for the turkey only - I haven't tried the panzanella yet."

I think I am so used to eating dry cooked turkey throughout the years maybe I don't know what a well cooked turkey is like.  I did use a thermometer to ensure doneness &amp; took the temp of various parts of the turkey.  Next time I will pay extra for a free range organic turkey. I wasn't very happy w/the butterball turkey I used. The breasts had a fat deposit in the middle of each breast &amp; it grossed me out.  The brine mix was a bit too salty for me too. If I do this again I will use less salt but then I am not sure how this will effect the brine.  The skin was crispy but almost tough, could be the low quality of the turkey. Even if I don't dry brine the turkey I will definitely butterfly my turkey. "

The whole dinner turned out awesome, especially the roasted vegetables. I think I have a new favorite. Spreading the preparation over a few days did make for a more relaxed Thanksgiving Day."

      "reviewBody": "This was very good! The turkey didn't look great coming out of the fridge (kind of grey color so i was a little worried but it turned out pretty good. You can't go bigger than the recommended size though, because even though a had a HUGE roasting pan underneath for the panzanella the turkey dripped outside of it landing in the oven and created alot of smoke in the house. It was better once I turned it down. The turkey needed to be cooked longer also - Everything was pink in the center and the finish temp I had was 165 in the thickest part of the breast...so I don't know. The panzanella acted as a great stuffing replacement soooo tasty and we hate brussel sprouts in this house! Every year I try new brussel sprout recipes to no avail until this one! You rock Alton!"

The panzanella salad was delicious but I substituted carrots for the parsnips which also added a great color addition. Together, the combo of the turkey and roasted root vegetables, was terrific. Loved this, and will definitely make again!  "

Ditto to nayray re: spinectomy...a little more difficult than anticipated.  My turkey actually took a little longer to cook (about 25 minutes longer at 350 but still came out perfect.  I threw a sheet pan with some root veg underneath to catch the drippings which made excellent gravy! Would definitely do this again...next time with a handsaw!!"

      "reviewBody": "This turkey rocked. I opted to make something other than the accompanying panzanella, so I'll pass along my lessons learned. Important safety tip: place something under the turkey to absorb the drippings! I uses a sheet pan, but that resulted in smoke that nearly drove everyone out of the house! A nice pan of dressing would absorb the liquid nicely, but be forewarned.<br />Additionally, the bird was ready well ahead of schedule.<br />Alton is a true food genius."

Directions

[] WATCH []

Watch how to make this recipe.

1.  For the turkey: Four days before service, place the salt, sage,
    thyme, black peppercorns, and allspice into a spice grinder and
    pulse until the peppercorns and allspice are coarsely ground, 5 to 6
    pulses. Set aside. 
2.  Set the turkey, breast-side down, on a large cutting board with the
    tail closest to you. Use an electric knife or heavy-duty kitchen
    shears to cut up one side of the backbone. Turn the bird around and
    cut back down the other side of the spine. Reserve the backbone for
    Giblet Stock. Discard any fat pockets or excess skin found inside
    the turkey. Turn the turkey breast-side up and use the heel of your
    hands to press down on both breasts, until you hear a cracking sound
    and the bird has flattened slightly. 
3.  Rub the seasoned salt on both sides of the turkey. Place the turkey
    on a parchment paper lined half sheet pan, breast-side up with legs
    running with the long side of the pan. Store, uncovered, in the
    refrigerator for 4 days. 
4.  Remove the turkey from the refrigerator and leave at room
    temperature for 1 hour. 
5.  For the panzanella: Place the parsnips and rutabaga in a large
    nonstick roasting pan, toss with vegetable oil and set aside. 
6.  Place one rack in the middle of the oven and a second one far enough
    below so the roasting pan will fit. Heat the oven to 425 degrees F.
    Place the turkey directly on the middle rack of the oven with the
    legs perpendicular to the metal bars of the rack. 
7.  Place the roasting pan with the parsnips and rutabaga on the rack
    below the turkey and roast both for 30 minutes. 
8.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. Add the red onion to the roasting
    vegetables and stir to combine. Continue to roast both the
    vegetables and the turkey until a probe thermometer inserted into
    the thickest part of the breast registers 155 degrees F, an
    additional 40 to 50 minutes.
9.  Remove the turkey from the oven onto a cooling rack set inside a
    half sheet pan and rest for 30 minutes. 
10. Add the Brussels sprouts, bread cubes and garlic to the roasting
    vegetables, stir to combine and roast for an additional 15 minutes.
    Remove the vegetables from the oven and immediately transfer to a
    serving bowl. Pour the apple cider vinegar in the warm roasting pan,
    stir and scrape off any browned bits from the pan. Pour the vinegar
    mixture over the salad, add the thyme and toss to combine. Season
    with salt and pepper as desired. Serve warm or at room temperature. 
11. Carve the turkey with an electric knife and serve with the
    panzanella.
