  "name": "Pressure Cooker Mushroom and Wild Rice Soup",
  "description": "This comforting soup tastes long-simmered, but it’s cooked in a pressure cooker, which makes it a weeknight possibility (though you could also make this recipe in a slow cooker). Use any variety of mushrooms you like: Cremini (also called baby bella) are affordable and easy to find and work well, or you can add shiitake or oyster mushrooms for a mix of texture and flavors. Don’t worry about removing small, supple stems, but discard any that are tough or dried-out. Wild rice isn’t a true rice at all but the seed of a grass that’s native to North America. When it’s cooked, it should be pleasantly chewy and nutty, not hard, and most of the grains should be slightly split open to reveal their creamy insides.",

Pressure Cooker Mushroom and Wild Rice Soup

By Sarah DiGregorio

[Pressure Cooker Mushroom and Wild Rice Soup]

Notes

This comforting soup tastes long-simmered, but it’s cooked in a pressure
cooker, which makes it a weeknight possibility (though you could also
make this recipe in a slow cooker). Use any variety of mushrooms you
like: Cremini (also called baby bella) are affordable and easy to find
and work well, or you can add shiitake or oyster mushrooms for a mix of
texture and flavors. Don’t worry about removing small, supple stems, but
discard any that are tough or dried-out. Wild rice isn’t a true rice at
all but the seed of a grass that’s native to North America. When it’s
cooked, it should be pleasantly chewy and nutty, not hard, and most of
the grains should be slightly split open to reveal their creamy insides.

Preparation

1.  Step 1

    Turn on the sauté setting on a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure
    cooker. Melt the butter, then add the onion. Cook, stirring
    occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes.

2.  Step 2

    Add the mushrooms and 1 teaspoon salt, and cook, stirring
    occasionally, until the mushrooms have released their liquid and
    shrunk a bit, about 8 minutes. Add the celery, carrot, chopped
    garlic, thyme, garlic powder and several generous grinds of black
    pepper. Stir to combine. Add the flour and stir until the vegetables
    are evenly coated and no white spots remain.

3.  Step 3

    Pour in the stock and wine, and turn off the heat. Scrape the bottom
    of the pot very well to incorporate flour and any browned bits that
    are stuck to the bottom. (This will add flavor and also prevent a
    burn warning later.) Stir in the wild rice.

4.  Step 4

    Cook on high pressure for 10 to 12 minutes. Turn off the heat and
    let the pressure reduce naturally for 10 minutes, then release the
    remaining pressure manually.

5.  Step 5

    Stir the soup and check the texture of the wild rice; if it needs a
    bit more time repeat the pressure cooking process for a cook time of
    2 minutes and rapidly release the pressure. Check the texture of the
    soup; if you’d like it to be thicker, turn on the sauté function and
    let the soup simmer to reduce to desired consistency. Turn off the
    heat.

6.  Step 6

    Put the sour cream in a small bowl and slowly whisk in a few
    spoonfuls of warm soup until smooth, then stir the mixture into the
    soup. (This prevents the sour cream from separating.) Taste the soup
    and add salt and pepper to taste.

7.  Step 7

    Serve the soup in bowls topped with chopped scallions or chives and
    dill. Reheat any leftovers on low until warm. (Boiling can cause the
    sour cream to break.)

Tip

-   If you prefer to cook without wine, instead add ¼ cup more water or
    stock and 2 teaspoons of white wine vinegar or lemon juice.

To make without pressure or slow cooker: Once you've stirred in the wild
rice at the end of step 3, simmer the soup covered until the rice is
cooked. The time will vary depending on your rice (and how old it is),
but figure about 40-45 minutes.

For a slow cooker, sauté as directed in a saucepan. Add sautéed veggies
to slow cooker with rest of ingredients (except cream and garnish). Cook
on low for 8 hours of on high for 6 hours. Check in to ensure sufficient
liquid occasionally. When wild rice cracks open so you can see the
lighter color inside, it’s ready. Mix in the cream and add garnish per
the recipe.

Very VERY tasty soup! We are eating low fat plant based diet, so I left
off the butter (using a spritz of olive oil cooking spray instead) and
substituted soy milk for the sour cream. The wild rice we had on hand
was Lundberg's wild rice blend and that cooked up perfectly with 10
minutes cook time in our Instapot. Turned out rich and delicious!

I've made a stove top version of this for years. Since wild rice,
depending upon age and source, can often be hard and chewy, I routinely
soak it all day or even overnight.

elizaBeth Simpson3 years ago

to questions about doing stovetop: you can also cook the wild rice
separately in the broth (either in a rice cooker or on the stove) and
add it at step 3, then just simmer a few minutes to incorporate. (I
think this is a plus to not overcook the flavor out of the
veggies/spices while the rice is cooking).

Delicious instapot recipe for a quick and “tastes like it cooked for
hours” soup! 3lb mushrooms, 7 cups water with “ better than bouillion”.
Added caraway seeds. 3/4 cup wild rice and 3/4 cup toasted fregula.
Fregula holds up in soups and adds a starch to make the soup creamier.
Finish on sautee function and added A head of lacinto kale and chard for
an all in one bowl meal. Garnish with yogurt and scallions. A 5 star!

If you want to stay with a creamy soup, you could make a cashew cream
(equal parts soaked raw cashews - discard soaking water - and water,
blitzed in a blender til smooth), as well as some extra lemon juice for
tang.

I made this soup in a 5 qt le creuset dutch oven on the top of the
stove, and after stirring in the rice, I put it covered in a 300 degree
oven for 2 hours. (Check every 30 minutes to be sure there's still
enough liquid - I didn't have to add any.) The rice came out perfect,
and the house smelled delicious all afternoon. I used half shitaki and
half crimini mushrooms, rice flour (GF), vegetable stock, 1/4 cup lemon
juice instead of wine, and soy milk instead of sour cream. Came out
great!

Not sure what went wrong here. I followed the directions to a T but
found the soup to be more like a casserole. I had to add 3 additional
cups of chicken broth after it cooked to get more of a soup consistency.
The flavor was okay. I served this to guests who claimed to like it but
I have to wonder if they were being polite. Wouldn’t make again.

Obsessed. It is super comforting while not too heavy. My advice: - My
personal principle is to not waste stock on pressure cooker recipes.
Just use water. It will become stock in there anyways. - Wild rice is
hard to find around here. I used the quick cooking farro from Trader
Joe's. The 10 min cook time in this recipe yields perfect texture.

I replaced half the broth with the liquid from soaking some dried
boletas and porcini mushrooms. I also chopped and tossed in the
rehydrated mushrooms along with the fresh. Otherwise followed the
recipe. It was amazing!

Added thinly sliced chicken breast to soup before pressure cooking, then
stirred in chopped Lacinato kale after natural pressure real ease for 10
minutes and cooked on normal for a minute or so while stirring soup to
keep rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Finished with a little
sherry in the soup pot and labne in the bowl instead of sour cream.
Really phenomenal. Wouldn’t omit the kale, it made the soup!

I learned my lesson about old wild rice. After an additional 6-8 minutes
under pressure it still wasn’t tender. Otherwise the soup was really
delicious. Will parboil it next time before adding.

I make without the sour cream, we prefer the broth base. Parsley instead
of dill and a nice crusty baguette with some French butter on the side.
Perfect!

I cut butter in half, used black lentils instead of rice for added
protein and upped the broth. Next time I’d chop the mushrooms a bit
smaller.

I added a few teaspoons of miso paste to this recipe at the end and I
omitted adding the sour cream to the entire dish. Instead, I put a
dollop of sour cream in each serving and mixed it. This way I can freeze
portions without it getting weird.

Delicious soup recipe! Changes I made: used half the butter and added
olive oil. Added rehydrated mushroom mix for some extra umami. Followed
the wine substitution method but instead of using broth, added the water
used to soak dehydrated mushrooms. Topped the soup with truffle oil.
Changes for next time: more rice to add bulk (possibly 1.5 cups)
Definitely not a quick weeknight dinner recipe. 1 hour cook time is
accurate. But good for meal prep and I think has excellent ROI.

I just cooked this soup and it’s delicious. I prepared the soup on my
stove top. Cooked the brown rice/wild rice combination in a separate pot
with chicken stock. Cooked all the other ingredients in my large stock
pot separately. I did add butter that was already mixed with white miso
from my refrigerator.. I would serve this with crispy toasted baguettes
I just cookedand a Caesar salad on the side. I couldn’t be more pleased
with this dish. I’m sure that it freezes well. this soup is a winner

Rice no where near cooked at 12 mins. Put in for another 8 mins. Still
quite chewy - I know it's supposed to be somewhat, but I probably would
add more stock and pressure cook for 20 mins in future. Perhaps I'm less
adept at chopping, but I wouldn't consider this a week night dish.

This made a delicious soup! Not the biggest garlic fan for soups, so I
reduced to 4 garlic cloves and scratched the garlic powder. Added 2 bay
leaves. The 6 qt instant pot is not big enough to accommodate all the
mushrooms that this recipe calls for. It can fit 1.5 lbs of mushrooms, 2
lbs was a bit too ambitious.

Manzanilla instead of red wine. Triple the thyme. Additional butter at
the end instead of sour cream. I found the sour cream muddled the
exquisite taste of the shrooms, butter and sherry. As written, this
doesn’t quite work as vegetarian stroganoff.

Erika9 months ago

So good! Leftovers were excellent too. Easily cooked on the stove-top in
a Dutch oven with slight modification. I added 2 stalks of leeks, as
they seemed fitting. I put the firmer vegetables in after the onion to
cook down and sweat, then put all of the mushrooms in until they shrunk
too. I added the broth, wild rice, etc as directed and let it simmer for
~45min. Then sour cream, etc. The textures were all perfect that way.
Just test the rice here and there to taste when it's done. Enjoy!
