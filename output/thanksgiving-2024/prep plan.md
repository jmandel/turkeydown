Here's a strategic prep schedule in table format:

| Day | Turkey | Soups/Sides | Vegetables | Baked Goods | Desserts |
|-----|---------|-------------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Sunday Night | Remove backbone, apply dry brine, refrigerate uncovered | - | - | - | - |
| Monday | Continue brining | Make cranberry sauce and refrigerate | - | - | Make pumpkin bundt cake, wrap well once cooled |
| Tuesday | Continue brining | - | Trim green beans and broccoli rabe, store properly | Make & freeze biscuit dough (don't bake) | Make apple tart dough, wrap & chill |
| Wednesday | Continue brining | Prep mushroom soup ingredients (chop vegetables, measure ingredients) | Prep root vegetables for panzanella (cube parsnips, dice onions, shred sprouts) | - | Assemble apple tart but don't bake |
| Thursday AM | Remove from fridge 1hr before cooking. Roast per recipe. Make gravy after. | Make mushroom rice soup | 1. Blanch green beans & rabe early<br>2. Final cooking of all vegetables just before serving<br>3. Roast panzanella vegetables | 1. Bake biscuits fresh<br>2. Reheat briefly if needed | 1. Bake apple tart<br>2. Make maple glaze for bundt |

Key timing notes:
- Turkey needs full 4 days of dry brining
- Fresh-baked biscuits and tart are superior
- Cranberry sauce improves with time to set
- Bundt cake stays fresh several days
- Vegetables should be prepped ahead but final cooking done just before serving
- Soup can be made earlier Thursday and kept warm
