# Prep Plan

Here's a prep schedule table for Thanksgiving (I'll mark critical timing-sensitive tasks with *):

| Day | Turkey | Wild Rice Soup | Green Beans | Broccoli Rabe | Cranberry Sauce | Gravy | Panzanella | Biscuits | Apple Tart | Pumpkin Bundt |
|-----|--------|----------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Sunday | *Butterfly & dry brine turkey, start 4-day cure | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | Make & chill dough | - |
| Monday | Continue cure | Make soup, store | - | - | Make sauce, chill | - | Cut bread, let stale | - | - | - |
| Tuesday | Continue cure | - | Trim beans | Clean & trim rabe | - | Prep herbs | Cube vegetables | Roast & puree squash | - | Make cake, store |
| Wednesday | Continue cure | - | Blanch beans, dry & store | - | - | Make base w/stock (no drippings) | - | Make dough, chill | Make filling | - |
| Thursday AM | *Remove from fridge 1hr before cook | Reheat gently | *Final sauté before serving | *Sauté just before serving | Bring to room temp | *Finish w/drippings | *Roast with turkey, assemble | *Bake fresh | *Bake fresh | Glaze cake |

Key timing notes:
- Turkey needs full 4 days for dry brine
- Fresh-baked items (biscuits, tart) scheduled for Thursday
- Hot vegetables (green beans, rabe) final cooking just before serving
- Soup, cranberry sauce, bundt cake benefit from make-ahead
- Root vegetable panzanella roasts alongside turkey
- Gravy base can be made ahead, finished with fresh drippings
