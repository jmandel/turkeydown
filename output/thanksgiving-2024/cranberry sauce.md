  "description": "This homemade cranberry sauce recipe combines sugar, cranberries, fresh organge zest and juice for a sweet. Cranberry sauce should be sweet but not cloying, and tart without causing pucker and anguish. It should have a jelly-like quality, but should owe more to the appearance of jam. ",

Cranberry Sauce

Notes

Cranberry sauce should be sweet but not cloying, and tart without
causing pucker and anguish. It should have a jelly-like quality, but
should owe more to the appearance of jam. The key element to making
cranberry sauce is to understand that cranberries are high in pectin, a
carbohydrate that exists in many fruits and which is released by the
berries when they are heated and the cells of the fruit break down. In
the presence of sugar, the pectin molecules bond to one another, forming
a kind of gel. The longer you cook a cranberry sauce, the more pectin is
released and liquid is evaporated, and the stiffer the result will be.
Science! Sometimes it's helpful. So is spice. Some like a clove or two
added to their cranberry sauce. (I am not one of them.) Others, a
whisper of ginger and a small handful of nuts, for texture. Of this, I
approve. Discover more ideas for the big day in our best Thanksgiving
recipes collection.

I like the recipe on the bag of cranberries, but I start with only 1/2
the sugar, and taste it as I go. I usually end up adding another 1/3 cup
of sugar - it really depends on your cranberries. I find that adding the
orange juice after it's really thick tastes better - cooked orange juice
can be bitter. I add the fresh zest at the same time. Delicious!

A tipple of Grand Marnier as it cools is a nice touch.

This sauce is so good on sandwiches made with leftover turkey: Sturdy
white or wheat bread, mayo, swiss, turkey, sauce, lettuce (or not). I
keep a bag or two of cranberries in the basement freezer just to make
this sauce for sandwiches during non-holiday times of the year. I like
it on ham sandwiches, too.

For us, this was just too sweet and too orange-y, even with only 1/2 cup
sugar. Next time we'll go back to the tried-and-true orange zest plus
water, not juice.

Patty H.6 years ago

I follow the recipe on the bag of fresh cranberries adding water and
orange in equal amounts. I add a generous amount of orange zest and a
piece of fresh peeled ginger root cut into slices which I remove after
the cranberry sauce has chilled. That definitely kicks it up a notch.

I usually make another dish that requires I strain the juice from a can
of pineapple bits. I use the pineapple juice in place of the orange
juice. The dish is very popular with our friends and is requested for
T'day pot luck dinners

I did not have Grand Marnier but added a tipple of Cointreau, which is
also an orange liqueuer. Grated ginger and orange rind. And this keeps
for months in a glass jar in the fridge. Great on toasted english
muffins!

Agree with other commenters - just too sweet. I fixed with a squirt of
lemon juice. Will use stated amount of orange juice but much less sugar
(perhaps 1/3 or 1/4 c) next time.

I picked this recipe for its simplicity as I instructed my fiancé from
the sofa ;). It is simple and tasty, but I would use less sugar in my
next batch, or double the cranberries, as others have suggested. I added
a couple dashes of Vietnamese cinnamon and ground clove, which punched
the flavor up just enough to enhance without tasting overwhelmingly
spiced. Could also add a whole clove or two. This is a good base for all
sorts of variations to your taste.

This is pretty much the same recipe I have used for years! However, some

So, I make a double recipe and put some through my Foley food mill! Any
leftover after the big day makes a great toast topper!

My go to recipe is similar but swap the sugar for pure maple syrup and
reduce to 1/2 cup, add 1 tsp vanilla (makes all the difference!), and
optional 1 tbs fresh thyme. Perfect.

I didn't have any orange juice (note to self: get some frozen

I cook my cranberries in organic tart cherry juice with a quartered (
previously zested) orange . I add sugar as I go I don’t like it too
sweet. Depending on my mood I’ll add either vanilla or grand marnier but
lately it’s been vanilla then add the zest. After Canadian then American
thanksgiving and xmas I am all in for cranberry sauce on toast because
really it’s the best ever jam!

The sweeter the better. One cup of sugar, zest an orange, juice the
orange, throw the whole thing in the pot while the berries are cooking.
Don't forget the cinnamon stick. Delicious. I then refrigerate, if
there's anything left over, leaving the orange rind and cinnamon stick
in with the cranberry sauce...heightens the flavor.

I add garam masala to the cranberry sauce in the last minute or two of
cooking. Sometimes I'll add orange zest, sometimes not, but always garam
masala.

I also use the recipe on the Ocean Spray bag but only 1/2 cup sugar and
a teaspoon of orange extract per bag (I make multiple bags at a time)
and when the cranberries come to a boil I add a cinnamon stick per bag.
I freeze a couple of quarts in small containers to use throughout the
winter as a topping for my breakfast yogurt. So tasty. And so pretty.
(P.S. I really love everyone's input on this forum; so many great
ideas.)

What is the minimum amount of sugar needed to make the pectin gel? There
will be a diabetic at the dinner, so I’d like to use the least possible
sugar and adjust sweetness, if necessary, with stevia.

FAQS

1.  How do I make cranberry sauce?[]

    To make cranberry sauce, you need three ingredients: cranberries,
    sugar and cooking liquid. Combine fresh or frozen cranberries with
    sugar and liquid, such as orange juice or water, in a saucepan over
    medium-high. Cook until the sugar dissolves and cranberries burst.
    Stir, adding seasonings like orange or lemon zest, or spices if you
    like, then cook a few more minutes, until saucy. Let the cranberry
    sauce cool, then transfer to a serving dish, cover and chill in the
    refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving.

2.  Can you freeze cranberry sauce? []

    Any cranberry sauce made without gelatin can be stored in an
    airtight container in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw in the
    refrigerator overnight before serving. Cranberry molds, or any other
    sauce that is set with gelatin, cannot be frozen.

3.  What should I do with leftover cranberry sauce?[]

    Leftover cranberry sauce can be used like a jam or jelly to spread
    on sandwiches. You can also make a salsa with it, combine it with
    whipped cream and yogurt for an easy treat or dessert topping,
    slather it on pancakes or waffles or even bake it into a hot
    pocket.
