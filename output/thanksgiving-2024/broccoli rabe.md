Here's a simple recipe for sautéed broccoli rabe with garlic and red pepper flakes:

Ingredients:
- 1 bunch broccoli rabe (rapini), trimmed
- 4-5 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 2-3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/4-1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)
- Salt to taste
- Black pepper to taste

Instructions:
1. Trim tough ends from broccoli rabe and cut into 2-inch pieces.

2. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Blanch broccoli rabe for 1-2 minutes, then drain and immediately place in ice water to stop cooking. Drain well.

3. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.

4. Add sliced garlic and red pepper flakes, sauté until garlic is lightly golden (1-2 minutes).

5. Add blanched broccoli rabe to the pan and season with salt and black pepper.

6. Sauté for 3-5 minutes until heated through and tender-crisp.

7. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.

Serve hot as a side dish. This pairs well with Italian dishes or any protein of your choice.
