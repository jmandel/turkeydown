Just throw 'em in an iron skillet with olive oil etc and a lid (to keep oil popping all over) and flip a couple times over a couple minutes. \n\nTo have it somewhere in between do not boil it over 2 minutes... absolute max. I think this recipe was written for throwing frozen beans straight from tbe freezer into the pot, not, fresn beans.\n\nThere really isn't any reason to boil them.",

Here is a recipe for fresh green beans, boiled just until barely tender
and bright green, then tossed in a pan with minced garlic and ginger.
The beans can be cooked a day ahead, leaving nothing more to do before
the meal than to assemble everything over high heat.

Preparation

1.  Step 1

    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and fill a large bowl
    with ice water. Working in two batches, boil beans until just tender
    but still crisp and bright green. Start testing after 4 minutes or
    so, being careful not to overcook. When done, plunge beans into ice
    water to stop cooking, lift out immediately when cool and drain on
    towels. (Recipe can be made to this point up to a day in advance and
    kept refrigerated, wrapped in towels.)

2.  Step 2

    When ready to cook, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wide skillet over
    high heat. Add half the beans, half the ginger and half the garlic,
    and cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until beans are heated
    through and ginger and garlic are softened and aromatic. Sprinkle
    with salt, and remove to a serving dish. Repeat with remaining oil,
    beans, ginger and garlic. Serve.

I add 1 T of soy sauce and 1 T of White wine vinegar ( or sherry
vinegar) for a minute, before the ginger and garlic. Delicious.

I never boil beans! They should actually be steamed. Bring the beans to
a boil, then immediately turn off the heat and cover the pot. Let them
sit for a few minutes, taste one to test, then drain.
If you do this, they will be perfect when reheated the next day.

At four minutes of boiling, I had already overcooked the beans. Check
well before then.

We keep bags of fresh ginger in the freezer. When we want to use it in a
finely-shredded way, we use a microplane. No need to thaw or peel --
just grate from frozen.

Neal7 years ago

Don't understand why one would ever boil the beans. Boiling them changes
the taste (dilutes the carbohydrates and thus the sweetness) and leaches
out vitamins and other nutrients. Steaming cooks them more quickly
because steam has a higher temperature than boiling water.

Janet7 years ago

I stop cooking as soon as the color turns bright. Since garlic burns and
turns bitter very quickly on high heat I get the beans heated through,
then add ginger to warm up, add the garlic last, just to warm up and
scent the air. For best flavor, do not let garlic color beyond golden,
remove from pan immediately.

With 2 1/2 lbs of beans, this works very well in a wok, do the whole
thing in one shot. And if you throw in a few mushrooms it works even
better.

I agree with the other posters, the beans get tender VERY quickly and I
would start checking even after 1 minute. Also, I melted down a touch of
butter in a small sauce pan and added the ginger/garlic mixture- heating
and stirring for maybe 2 minutes. I then combined it with the beans in
the skillet. Delicious results!

I enjoy lightly steaming the beans, not cook them through, then saute
them at high heat, adding the garlic, etc. toward the end as not to
scorch.

Ginger is fiber and juice, so pressing it won't get you the intensity of
flavor because, as you said, you'll get juice. Grating it on a box
grater will work for incorporation of the flavor, or finely chopping it
will give you bits of intense flavor.

Added a little toasted sesame oil to make it more blatantly Asian. Might
try adding chopped fermented black beans next time for more umami.

These were great! I thought that maybe the recipe was calling for too
much ginger but it married to the garlic and beans wonderfully. To save
time, I used packaged--Yes, more expensive-- green beans that had
already been cleaned and the stems cut off.

Has anyone ever tried this with black garlic? I’ve not cooked with it

I found this having had it many times at a local restaurant. And trying
it pulling beans out of boil at 2nin 30 sec. If you want snappy crunch,
like the restaurant, skip the boiling. Just throw 'em in an iron skillet
with olive oil etc and a lid (to keep oil popping all over) and flip a
couple times over a couple minutes. To have it somewhere in between do
not boil it over 2 minutes... absolute max. I think this recipe was
written for throwing frozen beans straight from tbe freezer into the
pot, not, fresn beans. There really isn't any reason to boil them.

This is my new favorite way to cook fresh green beans! I'm glad that I
did step 1 the night before, as that made it an easy side to assemble
(step 2) on a busy night. I wasn't sure I would like the combination of
ginger & garlic, but it was very well received!

Remember Graham Kerr, "The Galloping Gourmet"? He had a similar recipe
using butter instead of vegetable oil and nutmeg instead of ginger. It's
very French and sophisticated, if that's not redundant.

Step 1\n\n    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and fill a large bowl\n    with ice water. Working in two batches, boil beans until just tender\n    but still crisp and bright green. Start testing after 4 minutes or\n    so, being careful not to overcook. When done, plunge beans into ice\n    water to stop cooking, lift out immediately when cool and drain on\n    towels. (Recipe can be made to this point up to a day in advance and\n    kept refrigerated, wrapped in towels.)\n\n2.  Step 2\n\n    When ready to cook, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wide skillet over\n    high heat. Add half the beans, half the ginger and half the garlic,\n    and cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until beans are heated\n    through and ginger and garlic are softened and aromatic. Sprinkle\n    with salt, and remove to a serving dish. Repeat with remaining oil,\n    beans, ginger and garlic. Serve.\n\nSimilar Recipes\n\n[]\n\n-   \n    [Green Beans With Lime and Red Onions]\n\n    Green Beans With Lime and Red Onions\n\n    Melissa Clark\n-   \n    [Sautéed Green Beans]\n\n    Sautéed Green Beans\n\n    Kia Damon\n-   \n    [Green Beans and Tomatoes]\n\n    Green Beans and Tomatoes\n\n    Millie Peartree\n-   \n    [Crushed Green Bean Salad With Cranberry]\n\n    Crushed Green Bean Salad With Cranberry\n\n    Sohla El-Waylly\n-   \n    [Green Beans With Herbs and Olives]\n\n    Green Beans With Herbs and Olives\n\n    David Tanis\n-   \n    [Pan-Roasted Green Beans With Golden Almonds]\n\n    Pan-Roasted Green Beans With Golden Almonds\n\n    Tara Parker-Pope\n-   \n    [Spicy Black Bean Soup]\n\n    Spicy Black Bean Soup\n\n    Ali Slagle\n-   \n    [Green Beans With Dill]\n\n    Green Beans With Dill\n\n    Amanda Hesser\n-   \n    [Green Bean Salad With Hot Mustard Dressing]\n\n    Green Bean Salad With Hot Mustard Dressing\n\n    Kay Chun\n-   \n    [Rice and Peas]\n\n    Rice and Peas\n\n    Ashley Lonsdale\n-   \n    [Green Bean and Corn Almondine]\n\n    Green Bean and Corn Almondine\n\n    Kay Chun\n-   \n    [French Green Beans and Shallots]\n\n    French Green Beans and Shallots\n\n    Jacques Pepin\n-   \n    [Air-Fryer Green Beans]\n\n    Air-Fryer Green Beans\n\n    Eleanore Park\n-   \n    [Warm Cabbage and Green Beans]\n\n    Warm Cabbage and Green Beans\n\n    Elaine Louie\n-   \n    [Green Beans With Lemon Vinaigrette]\n\n    Green Beans With Lemon Vinaigrette\n\n    Mark Bittman\n-   \n    [Creamy White Beans With Herb Oil]\n\n    Creamy White Beans With Herb Oil\n\n    Colu Henry\n-   \n    [Creamy Braised White Beans]\n\n    Creamy Braised White Beans\n\n    Ali Slagle\n-   \n    [Green Bean Casserole]\n\n    Green Bean Casserole\n\n    Eric Kim\n-   \n    [Bean and Cheese Burritos]\n\n    Bean and Cheese Burritos\n\n    Kay Chun\n-   \n    [Baked Beans With Mint, Peppers and Tomatoes]\n\n    Baked Beans With Mint, Peppers and Tomatoes\n\n    Martha Rose Shulman\n\n[]\n\nRatings\n\n[]\n\n5 out of 5\n\n3,922 user ratings\n\nYour rating\n\n1 star[]2 stars[]3 stars[]4 stars[]5 stars[]\n\nSubmit\n\nLog in or sign up to rate this recipe.\n\nHave you cooked this?\n\n[]Mark as Cooked\n\nLog in or sign up to mark this recipe as cooked.\n\nPrivate Notes\n\nLeave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.\n\nCooking Notes\n\nAdd Note\n\nPublicPrivate\n\nSubmit\n\n-   All Notes\n-   Private\n\nA Mayer7 years ago\n\nI add 1 T of soy sauce and 1 T of White wine vinegar ( or sherry\nvinegar) for a minute, before the ginger and garlic. Delicious.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 389\n\nravelle7 years ago\n\nI never boil beans! They should actually be steamed. Bring the beans to\na boil, then immediately turn off the heat and cover the pot. Let them\nsit for a few minutes, taste one to test, then drain.\nIf you do this, they will be perfect when reheated the next day.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 375\n\nJ. David Nelson7 years ago\n\nAt four minutes of boiling, I had already overcooked the beans. Check\nwell before then.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 239\n\nBoxplayer6 years ago\n\nWe keep bags of fresh ginger in the freezer. When we want to use it in a\nfinely-shredded way, we use a microplane. No need to thaw or peel --\njust grate from frozen.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 233\n\nNeal7 years ago\n\nDon't understand why one would ever boil the beans. Boiling them changes\nthe taste (dilutes the carbohydrates and thus the sweetness) and leaches\nout vitamins and other nutrients. Steaming cooks them more quickly\nbecause steam has a higher temperature than boiling water.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 188\n\nJanet7 years ago\n\nI stop cooking as soon as the color turns bright. Since garlic burns and\nturns bitter very quickly on high heat I get the beans heated through,\nthen add ginger to warm up, add the garlic last, just to warm up and\nscent the air. For best flavor, do not let garlic color beyond golden,\nremove from pan immediately.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 127\n\nEdward Baker7 years ago\n\nWith 2 1/2 lbs of beans, this works very well in a wok, do the whole\nthing in one shot. And if you throw in a few mushrooms it works even\nbetter.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 111\n\nLuckyJustLucky7 years ago\n\nCooked bean 2 minutes Added soy sauce to ginger and garlic, cut the oil\nin half\n\nIs this helpful?[] 81\n\nTommi-Grace7 years ago\n\nI agree with the other posters, the beans get tender VERY quickly and I\nwould start checking even after 1 minute. Also, I melted down a touch of\nbutter in a small sauce pan and added the ginger/garlic mixture- heating\nand stirring for maybe 2 minutes. I then combined it with the beans in\nthe skillet. Delicious results!\n\nIs this helpful?[] 80\n\nSteve7 years ago\n\nI enjoy lightly steaming the beans, not cook them through, then saute\nthem at high heat, adding the garlic, etc. toward the end as not to\nscorch.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 70\n\nLL7 years ago\n\nCook beans 3 minutes and Test for doneness.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 69\n\nEllie7 years ago\n\nThis was awesome!

Grating it on a box\ngrater will work for incorporation of the flavor, or finely chopping it\nwill give you bits of intense flavor.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 63\n\nCypridopsis7 years ago\n\nAdded a little toasted sesame oil to make it more blatantly Asian.

I thought that maybe the recipe was calling for too\nmuch ginger but it married to the garlic and beans wonderfully. To save\ntime, I used packaged--Yes, more expensive-- green beans that had\nalready been cleaned and the stems cut off.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 58\n\nNicole17 hours ago\n\nThank you Miss Moskin, I was looking for such a recipe for my nephew ‘s\nwife!

And trying\nit pulling beans out of boil at 2nin 30 sec. If you want snappy crunch,\nlike the restaurant, skip the boiling. Just throw 'em in an iron skillet\nwith olive oil etc and a lid (to keep oil popping all over) and flip a\ncouple times over a couple minutes. To have it somewhere in between do\nnot boil it over 2 minutes... absolute max. I think this recipe was\nwritten for throwing frozen beans straight from tbe freezer into the\npot, not, fresn beans. There really isn't any reason to boil them.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\njohnrf4 months ago\n\nSeems like a lot of ginger root.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nTara D.5 months ago\n\nThis is my new favorite way to cook fresh green beans!
