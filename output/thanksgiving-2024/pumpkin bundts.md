  "name": "Pumpkin Bundt Cake With Maple Brown-Butter Glaze",
  "description": "Bundt cakes are classic showstoppers — big, lofty and usually dressed in elegant drizzles and drips of glaze. Here, a dense, moist cake full of warm fall spices and pumpkin purée is encased in a layer of rich, nutty brown-butter maple glaze. Feel free to make it a day before you plan to serve it: This cake keeps well at room temperature, and you might think it's even better on the second day. Just make sure to keep it covered  and resist the urge to shave off a slice every time you walk by. If you can find it, use organic confectioners' sugar for the glaze. It's made from raw sugar and uses tapioca rather than cornstarch as its anticaking agent. It will give the glaze a richer taste and smoother texture than conventional confectioners’ sugar — a tip picked up from Stella Parks.",

I turned off the oven, reset the temp, guessed at the remaining time, and pulled out the cake when a toothpick came out clean.  Then put some yams in the oven.  Fifteen minutes later my apartment was suddenly filling up with smoke.  I turned off the oven and ran to get my doorman.  He discovered a flaming potholder in with the yams, pulled it out with his bare hands and threw it in the sink.  Meanwhile the cake was still on the cooling rack minding its own business despite the very dense smoke.  I opened every window and went to do laundry because the air was unbreathable.  Two hours later I returned, calmed myself down, and cautiously toasted the pepitas and made the glaze.  After glazing the cake I had to taste test before bringing it in to work to make sure it didn’t taste like ashes.  Delicious! and in a nutshell, indestructible. My doorman will be handsomely rewarded for saving the day.",

Pumpkin Bundt Cake With Maple Brown-Butter Glaze

Notes

Bundt cakes are classic showstoppers — big, lofty and usually dressed in
elegant drizzles and drips of glaze. Here, a dense, moist cake full of
warm fall spices and pumpkin purée is encased in a layer of rich, nutty
brown-butter maple glaze. Feel free to make it a day before you plan to
serve it: This cake keeps well at room temperature, and you might think
it's even better on the second day. Just make sure to keep it covered
and resist the urge to shave off a slice every time you walk by. If you
can find it, use organic confectioners' sugar for the glaze. It's made
from raw sugar and uses tapioca rather than cornstarch as its anticaking
agent. It will give the glaze a richer taste and smoother texture than
conventional confectioners’ sugar — a tip picked up from Stella Parks.

Preparation

1.  Step 1

    Heat oven to 350 degrees, and butter and flour a 12-cup (or larger)
    capacity bundt pan.

2.  Step 2

    In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt,
    cinnamon, cardamom, allspice and black pepper until well combined.

3.  Step 3

    In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,
    combine brown sugar, butter and olive oil. Beat on medium-high until
    light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time,
    mixing for about 20 seconds in between each egg. Add the pumpkin
    purée and sour cream, and mix until well combined, scraping the
    bottom and sides of the bowl as necessary.

4.  Step 4

    Remove the bowl from the mixer, and use a rubber spatula to fold in
    the dry ingredients until well combined. Make sure to scrape the
    bottom and sides of the bowl to ensure an evenly mixed batter.

5.  Step 5

    Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smooth the top and firmly tap
    the pan on the countertop a few times to release any large air
    bubbles. Bake the cake until golden and puffed, and a tester
    inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes.

6.  Step 6

    Set the cake, still in its pan, on a rack to cool for 20 minutes,
    then use the tip of a knife to loosen the edges and invert the cake
    onto the rack to cool completely before glazing.

7.  Step 7

    Make the glaze: Once the cake is cool, melt the butter in a saucepan
    over medium heat. Cook the butter, occasionally scraping the bottom
    and sides of the pan with a rubber spatula until it turns a deep
    golden brown and smells nutty. Don’t walk away from the pan during
    this process. The butter can go from brown and nutty to acrid and
    burnt in mere moments.

8.  Step 8

    Transfer butter and all the brown bits from the pan to a heat-safe
    bowl, and let it cool slightly. Whisk in the confectioners’ sugar,
    maple syrup and salt until smooth. The glaze should be thick but
    pourable. If it’s too thin, add a bit more confectioners’ sugar. If
    it’s too thick, add a few drops of water.

9.  Step 9

    Transfer the cake to a serving platter and pour the glaze evenly
    over the top. Sprinkle with pepitas if desired. Let the glaze set
    for a few minutes before slicing.

This is a very nice, moist cake - the olive oil recedes and the cardamom
takes over in a very pleasant way. I halved the recipe (measured) and
baked for 35 minutes in my small bundt pan. I used 2% greek yogurt in
place of the sour cream and reduced the brown sugar a bit (200 g). The
glaze hardens quickly so next time I would add more water. I did saute
the pepitas with a tiny bit of oil and tossed them in sugar which made
them crunchy and delicious. I will make this again.

halve recipe (200g br sugar); bake for 35 mins.... make glaze runnier
than you would think as it hardens pretty much immediately; saute
pepitas in tiny bit of oil and toss in sugar - really good cake

Hi. Will someone from the NYT — preferably either the actual baker of
the recipe or the food stylist — tell us how to get such a thick, rich
looking coating of icing? I’ve made this cake 6 times now (because it
tastes so darn good) but have never once seen the icing look as it does
in the publication’s photo.

I just gave this a go, pretty much following the recipe with the
recommended thinning of the glaze a bit. The only other change was
dusting the bundt pan with sugar and not flour. Really amazing fall feel
to it. Taking time to properly brown the butter adds a complexity to the
glaze that complements the pumpkin cake so well. Neighbors loved it and
more importantly my wife did. I might bump the spices up a bit next time
out, but this is a keeper.

Since I prefer weight to volume especially when baking, I measured the
brown sugar both ways because it seemed like a lot. I came up with 2
cups packed was 346 grams, not 440 grams. I find when I convert to
weights I often double check between weights and volume. They often do
not jibe in fact it's kind of like Celebrity Net Worth - untethered.

This bundt got rave reviews at thanksgiving. Did a few subs just because
I didn’t have all ingredients. Used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream,
added cloves and ground ginger in place of allspice and used dark brown
sugar. Cut confectioners sugar in icing by half and it was perfect.
Would definitely make again and the cardamom and black pepper gave it a
great depth of flavor and warmth. Moist, delicious and not too sweet.
Have already been asked to make it again.

Since my dad is gluten intolerant, I replaced the all purpose flour with
bob’s red mill 1 to 1 baking flour (in the blue bag)*. Cake was
delicious and no one could tell it was gluten free. *Do NOT confuse with
bob’s red mill gluten free all purpose flour. They are not the same.

My family and friends loved this cake a couple weeks ago. But everyone
wanted a bit of glaze in every bite, which you don’t get with a glazed
Bundt cake. So round two was made in a 9x13 pan. It took less time in
the oven (can’t recall the exact adjustment for time) and I doubled the
glaze to cover the whole top of the sheet cake. Toasted pepitas are a
must. The second cake this weekend was an even bigger hit with my
guests. Perfect fall dessert.

Cakes have been made for a lot longer than there has been electricity!
Of course you can do it with a hand held, too. You can even make it
without a stand or hand mixer by beating the heck out of everything with
a wooden spoon followed by a sturdy whisk. It's just more work to get
everything creamed and fluffy.

I used 2% Greek yogurt in place of sour cream, and the cake was
absolutely perfect. I learned a lesson about blindly following others'
advice: I added just a little water to the glaze, but that made it way
too thin and it all ran right off. I used organic powdered sugar, which
doesn't contain cornstarch, and I think that was the difference. Water
may be more helpful if using conventional powdered sugar with
cornstarch.

Delicious, show-stopping cake! Served for brunch and it was a hit. The
brown butter adds real depth and the pepitas shouldn’t be skipped. This
will definitely be a fall tradition.

I had excellent results while following the recipe although I had to use
half olive oil and half vegetable oil as my evoo was running low. THE
GLAZE: had no trouble getting mine to look identical to the photo
depicted here. I zapped in microwave for a few seconds prior to glazing
the cake. You need to act fast with powdered sugar glazes otherwise they
harden and make it impossible to get that beautiful drip. Used toasted
and chopped pecans for finishing. So good!

I made it exactly as written and agree that it's a beautiful cake. My
husband and guests loved it, but I confess to not caring for it very
much. That surprised me because these are flavors I usually love.
Perhaps boosting the quantity of spices would make me happier, so if I
make it again, I'll give that a try. I love the idea of using maple
syrup in the frosting, and will probably try that on other cakes I like
more.

I cooled mine 20 minutes and it came right out. I don't have Nordic Ware
though. I well buttered the pan and sprinkled with granulated sugar. The
pan was not warm to the touch after 20 minutes but if anything it came
out too easily.

Really excellent cake! My five-year-old, who prefers chocolate anything,
requests this for breakfast every day. But is a knife to release the
cake essential? Aren't most Bundts nonstick? I scratched the coating on
mine; probably should have tried first to release without the knife.

About halfway through the baking process I discovered that my oven temp
was 165 degrees. I turned off the oven, reset the temp, guessed at the
remaining time, and pulled out the cake when a toothpick came out clean.
Then put some yams in the oven. Fifteen minutes later my apartment was
suddenly filling up with smoke. I turned off the oven and ran to get my
doorman. He discovered a flaming potholder in with the yams, pulled it
out with his bare hands and threw it in the sink. Meanwhile the cake was
still on the cooling rack minding its own business despite the very
dense smoke. I opened every window and went to do laundry because the
air was unbreathable. Two hours later I returned, calmed myself down,
and cautiously toasted the pepitas and made the glaze. After glazing the
cake I had to taste test before bringing it in to work to make sure it
didn’t taste like ashes. Delicious! and in a nutshell, indestructible.
My doorman will be handsomely rewarded for saving the day.

I followed the recipe completely with the exception of substituting
small chocolate truffles to adorn the top of the cake instead of the
pepitas, which makes for a lovely presentation. I’ve made it twice and
both times almost everyone wanted seconds.

Yossy Arefi never leads me astray. This is a perfect recipe. I followed
it to a tee, made no alterations, and it turned out most and perfect.
Great flavour. My only gripe is I wish that every ingredient was listed
by weight. If I already have a scale out, it’s annoying to figure out
the weight of the maple syrup and olive oil. Will absolutely make this
again.

I am not a huge cardamom fan but normally I’m fine with it in baked

use a half or a quarter of what the recipe calls for.
