  "name": "Pumpkin Bundt Cake With Maple Brown-Butter Glaze",
  "description": "Bundt cakes are classic showstoppers — big, lofty and usually dressed in elegant drizzles and drips of glaze. Here, a dense, moist cake full of warm fall spices and pumpkin purée is encased in a layer of rich, nutty brown-butter maple glaze. Feel free to make it a day before you plan to serve it: This cake keeps well at room temperature, and you might think it's even better on the second day. Just make sure to keep it covered  and resist the urge to shave off a slice every time you walk by. If you can find it, use organic confectioners' sugar for the glaze. It's made from raw sugar and uses tapioca rather than cornstarch as its anticaking agent. It will give the glaze a richer taste and smoother texture than conventional confectioners’ sugar — a tip picked up from Stella Parks.",

I turned off the oven, reset the temp, guessed at the remaining time, and pulled out the cake when a toothpick came out clean.  Then put some yams in the oven.  Fifteen minutes later my apartment was suddenly filling up with smoke.  I turned off the oven and ran to get my doorman.  He discovered a flaming potholder in with the yams, pulled it out with his bare hands and threw it in the sink.  Meanwhile the cake was still on the cooling rack minding its own business despite the very dense smoke.  I opened every window and went to do laundry because the air was unbreathable.  Two hours later I returned, calmed myself down, and cautiously toasted the pepitas and made the glaze.  After glazing the cake I had to taste test before bringing it in to work to make sure it didn’t taste like ashes.  Delicious! and in a nutshell, indestructible. My doorman will be handsomely rewarded for saving the day.",

Pumpkin Bundt Cake With Maple Brown-Butter Glaze

Notes

Bundt cakes are classic showstoppers — big, lofty and usually dressed in
elegant drizzles and drips of glaze. Here, a dense, moist cake full of
warm fall spices and pumpkin purée is encased in a layer of rich, nutty
brown-butter maple glaze. Feel free to make it a day before you plan to
serve it: This cake keeps well at room temperature, and you might think
it's even better on the second day. Just make sure to keep it covered
and resist the urge to shave off a slice every time you walk by. If you
can find it, use organic confectioners' sugar for the glaze. It's made
from raw sugar and uses tapioca rather than cornstarch as its anticaking
agent. It will give the glaze a richer taste and smoother texture than
conventional confectioners’ sugar — a tip picked up from Stella Parks.

Preparation

1.  Step 1

    Heat oven to 350 degrees, and butter and flour a 12-cup (or larger)
    capacity bundt pan.

2.  Step 2

    In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt,
    cinnamon, cardamom, allspice and black pepper until well combined.

3.  Step 3

    In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,
    combine brown sugar, butter and olive oil. Beat on medium-high until
    light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time,
    mixing for about 20 seconds in between each egg. Add the pumpkin
    purée and sour cream, and mix until well combined, scraping the
    bottom and sides of the bowl as necessary.

4.  Step 4

    Remove the bowl from the mixer, and use a rubber spatula to fold in
    the dry ingredients until well combined. Make sure to scrape the
    bottom and sides of the bowl to ensure an evenly mixed batter.

5.  Step 5

    Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smooth the top and firmly tap
    the pan on the countertop a few times to release any large air
    bubbles. Bake the cake until golden and puffed, and a tester
    inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes.

6.  Step 6

    Set the cake, still in its pan, on a rack to cool for 20 minutes,
    then use the tip of a knife to loosen the edges and invert the cake
    onto the rack to cool completely before glazing.

7.  Step 7

    Make the glaze: Once the cake is cool, melt the butter in a saucepan
    over medium heat. Cook the butter, occasionally scraping the bottom
    and sides of the pan with a rubber spatula until it turns a deep
    golden brown and smells nutty. Don’t walk away from the pan during
    this process. The butter can go from brown and nutty to acrid and
    burnt in mere moments.

8.  Step 8

    Transfer butter and all the brown bits from the pan to a heat-safe
    bowl, and let it cool slightly. Whisk in the confectioners’ sugar,
    maple syrup and salt until smooth. The glaze should be thick but
    pourable. If it’s too thin, add a bit more confectioners’ sugar. If
    it’s too thick, add a few drops of water.

9.  Step 9

    Transfer the cake to a serving platter and pour the glaze evenly
    over the top. Sprinkle with pepitas if desired. Let the glaze set
    for a few minutes before slicing.

This is a very nice, moist cake - the olive oil recedes and the cardamom
takes over in a very pleasant way. I halved the recipe (measured) and
baked for 35 minutes in my small bundt pan. I used 2% greek yogurt in
place of the sour cream and reduced the brown sugar a bit (200 g). The
glaze hardens quickly so next time I would add more water. I did saute
the pepitas with a tiny bit of oil and tossed them in sugar which made
them crunchy and delicious. I will make this again.

halve recipe (200g br sugar); bake for 35 mins.... make glaze runnier
than you would think as it hardens pretty much immediately; saute
pepitas in tiny bit of oil and toss in sugar - really good cake

Hi. Will someone from the NYT — preferably either the actual baker of
the recipe or the food stylist — tell us how to get such a thick, rich
looking coating of icing? I’ve made this cake 6 times now (because it
tastes so darn good) but have never once seen the icing look as it does
in the publication’s photo.

I just gave this a go, pretty much following the recipe with the
recommended thinning of the glaze a bit. The only other change was
dusting the bundt pan with sugar and not flour. Really amazing fall feel
to it. Taking time to properly brown the butter adds a complexity to the
glaze that complements the pumpkin cake so well. Neighbors loved it and
more importantly my wife did. I might bump the spices up a bit next time
out, but this is a keeper.

Since I prefer weight to volume especially when baking, I measured the
brown sugar both ways because it seemed like a lot. I came up with 2
cups packed was 346 grams, not 440 grams. I find when I convert to
weights I often double check between weights and volume. They often do
not jibe in fact it's kind of like Celebrity Net Worth - untethered.

This bundt got rave reviews at thanksgiving. Did a few subs just because
I didn’t have all ingredients. Used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream,
added cloves and ground ginger in place of allspice and used dark brown
sugar. Cut confectioners sugar in icing by half and it was perfect.
Would definitely make again and the cardamom and black pepper gave it a
great depth of flavor and warmth. Moist, delicious and not too sweet.
Have already been asked to make it again.

Since my dad is gluten intolerant, I replaced the all purpose flour with
bob’s red mill 1 to 1 baking flour (in the blue bag)*. Cake was
delicious and no one could tell it was gluten free. *Do NOT confuse with
bob’s red mill gluten free all purpose flour. They are not the same.

My family and friends loved this cake a couple weeks ago. But everyone
wanted a bit of glaze in every bite, which you don’t get with a glazed
Bundt cake. So round two was made in a 9x13 pan. It took less time in
the oven (can’t recall the exact adjustment for time) and I doubled the
glaze to cover the whole top of the sheet cake. Toasted pepitas are a
must. The second cake this weekend was an even bigger hit with my
guests. Perfect fall dessert.

Cakes have been made for a lot longer than there has been electricity!
Of course you can do it with a hand held, too. You can even make it
without a stand or hand mixer by beating the heck out of everything with
a wooden spoon followed by a sturdy whisk. It's just more work to get
everything creamed and fluffy.

I used 2% Greek yogurt in place of sour cream, and the cake was
absolutely perfect. I learned a lesson about blindly following others'
advice: I added just a little water to the glaze, but that made it way
too thin and it all ran right off. I used organic powdered sugar, which
doesn't contain cornstarch, and I think that was the difference. Water
may be more helpful if using conventional powdered sugar with
cornstarch.

Delicious, show-stopping cake! Served for brunch and it was a hit. The
brown butter adds real depth and the pepitas shouldn’t be skipped. This
will definitely be a fall tradition.

I had excellent results while following the recipe although I had to use
half olive oil and half vegetable oil as my evoo was running low. THE
GLAZE: had no trouble getting mine to look identical to the photo
depicted here. I zapped in microwave for a few seconds prior to glazing
the cake. You need to act fast with powdered sugar glazes otherwise they
harden and make it impossible to get that beautiful drip. Used toasted
and chopped pecans for finishing. So good!

I made it exactly as written and agree that it's a beautiful cake. My
husband and guests loved it, but I confess to not caring for it very
much. That surprised me because these are flavors I usually love.
Perhaps boosting the quantity of spices would make me happier, so if I
make it again, I'll give that a try. I love the idea of using maple
syrup in the frosting, and will probably try that on other cakes I like
more.

I cooled mine 20 minutes and it came right out. I don't have Nordic Ware
though. I well buttered the pan and sprinkled with granulated sugar. The
pan was not warm to the touch after 20 minutes but if anything it came
out too easily.

Really excellent cake! My five-year-old, who prefers chocolate anything,
requests this for breakfast every day. But is a knife to release the
cake essential? Aren't most Bundts nonstick? I scratched the coating on
mine; probably should have tried first to release without the knife.

About halfway through the baking process I discovered that my oven temp
was 165 degrees. I turned off the oven, reset the temp, guessed at the
remaining time, and pulled out the cake when a toothpick came out clean.
Then put some yams in the oven. Fifteen minutes later my apartment was
suddenly filling up with smoke. I turned off the oven and ran to get my
doorman. He discovered a flaming potholder in with the yams, pulled it
out with his bare hands and threw it in the sink. Meanwhile the cake was
still on the cooling rack minding its own business despite the very
dense smoke. I opened every window and went to do laundry because the
air was unbreathable. Two hours later I returned, calmed myself down,
and cautiously toasted the pepitas and made the glaze. After glazing the
cake I had to taste test before bringing it in to work to make sure it
didn’t taste like ashes. Delicious! and in a nutshell, indestructible.
My doorman will be handsomely rewarded for saving the day.

I followed the recipe completely with the exception of substituting
small chocolate truffles to adorn the top of the cake instead of the
pepitas, which makes for a lovely presentation. I’ve made it twice and
both times almost everyone wanted seconds.

Yossy Arefi never leads me astray. This is a perfect recipe. I followed
it to a tee, made no alterations, and it turned out most and perfect.
Great flavour. My only gripe is I wish that every ingredient was listed
by weight. If I already have a scale out, it’s annoying to figure out
the weight of the maple syrup and olive oil. Will absolutely make this
again.

I am not a huge cardamom fan but normally I’m fine with it in baked

use a half or a quarter of what the recipe calls for.

Here, a dense, moist cake full of warm fall spices and pumpkin purée is encased in a layer of rich, nutty brown-butter maple glaze. Feel free to make it a day before you plan to serve it: This cake keeps well at room temperature, and you might think it's even better on the second day. Just make sure to keep it covered  and resist the urge to shave off a slice every time you walk by. If you can find it, use organic confectioners' sugar for the glaze. It's made from raw sugar and uses tapioca rather than cornstarch as its anticaking agent. It will give the glaze a richer taste and smoother texture than conventional confectioners’ sugar — a tip picked up from Stella Parks.\",\n  \"author\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Person\",\n    \"name\": \"Yossy Arefi\"\n  },\n  \"image\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/dining/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2-square640.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/dining/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2-square640.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 640,\n      \"width\": 640,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/dining/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2-superJumbo.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/dining/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2-superJumbo.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 1365,\n      \"width\": 2048,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/dining/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2-videoSmall.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/dining/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2-videoSmall.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 281,\n      \"width\": 500,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/dining/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/dining/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 1102,\n      \"width\": 735,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"totalTime\": \"PT2H\",\n  \"recipeYield\": \"10 to 12 servings\",\n  \"recipeCuisine\": \"\",\n  \"recipeCategory\": \"dessert\",\n  \"keywords\": \"allspice, brown butter, bundt cake, cardamom, cinnamon, make-ahead, pumpkin purée, fall, halloween, thanksgiving\",\n  \"aggregateRating\": {\n    \"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n    \"ratingValue\": 5,\n    \"ratingCount\": 2584\n  },\n  \"nutrition\": {\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"NutritionInformation\",\n    \"calories\": 522,\n    \"unsaturatedFatContent\": \"12 grams\",\n    \"carbohydrateContent\": \"78 grams\",\n    \"cholesterolContent\": null,\n    \"fatContent\": \"22 grams\",\n    \"fiberContent\": \"2 grams\",\n    \"proteinContent\": \"5 grams\",\n    \"saturatedFatContent\": \"9 grams\",\n    \"sodiumContent\": \"374 milligrams\",\n    \"sugarContent\": \"49 grams\",\n    \"transFatContent\": \"0 grams\"\n  },\n  \"recipeIngredient\": [\n    \"3 cups/384 grams all-purpose flour\",\n    \"2 teaspoons baking powder\",\n    \"1 teaspoon baking soda\",\n    \"1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt\",\n    \"2 teaspoons ground cinnamon\",\n    \"1 1/2 teaspoons ground cardamom\",\n    \"1/4 teaspoon ground allspice\",\n    \"1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper\",\n    \"2 cups/440 grams light brown sugar, packed\",\n    \"1/2 cup/114 grams unsalted butter, soft but cool\",\n    \"1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil\",\n    \"2 large eggs, at room temperature\",\n    \"1 (15-ounce) can/425 grams pumpkin purée\",\n    \"1/2 cup sour cream\",\n    \"2 tablespoons unsalted butter\",\n    \"1 cup/102 grams confectioners’ sugar (preferably organic), sifted\",\n    \"1/4 cup maple syrup\",\n    \"Pinch of salt\",\n    \"1 to 2 tablespoons lightly toasted pepitas (optional)\"\n  ],\n  \"recipeInstructions\": [\n    {\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"HowToStep\",\n      \"text\": \"Heat oven to 350 degrees, and butter and flour a 12-cup (or larger) capacity bundt pan.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"HowToStep\",\n      \"text\": \"In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, allspice and black pepper until well combined.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"HowToStep\",\n      \"text\": \"In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine brown sugar, butter and olive oil.

Fifteen minutes later my apartment was suddenly filling up with smoke.  I turned off the oven and ran to get my doorman.  He discovered a flaming potholder in with the yams, pulled it out with his bare hands and threw it in the sink.  Meanwhile the cake was still on the cooling rack minding its own business despite the very dense smoke.  I opened every window and went to do laundry because the air was unbreathable.  Two hours later I returned, calmed myself down, and cautiously toasted the pepitas and made the glaze.  After glazing the cake I had to taste test before bringing it in to work to make sure it didn’t taste like ashes.  Delicious! and in a nutshell, indestructible.

Here, a dense, moist cake full of\nwarm fall spices and pumpkin purée is encased in a layer of rich, nutty\nbrown-butter maple glaze. Feel free to make it a day before you plan to\nserve it: This cake keeps well at room temperature, and you might think\nit's even better on the second day. Just make sure to keep it covered\nand resist the urge to shave off a slice every time you walk by. If you\ncan find it, use organic confectioners' sugar for the glaze. It's made\nfrom raw sugar and uses tapioca rather than cornstarch as its anticaking\nagent. It will give the glaze a richer taste and smoother texture than\nconventional confectioners’ sugar — a tip picked up from Stella Parks.\n\nRead More\n\n-   []Save\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   []Give\n    Subscriber benefit: give recipes to anyone\n\n    As a subscriber, you have 10 gift recipes to give each month.

Step 1\n\n    Heat oven to 350 degrees, and butter and flour a 12-cup (or larger)\n    capacity bundt pan.\n\n2.  Step 2\n\n    In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt,\n    cinnamon, cardamom, allspice and black pepper until well combined.\n\n3.  Step 3\n\n    In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,\n    combine brown sugar, butter and olive oil. Beat on medium-high until\n    light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time,\n    mixing for about 20 seconds in between each egg. Add the pumpkin\n    purée and sour cream, and mix until well combined, scraping the\n    bottom and sides of the bowl as necessary.\n\n4.  Step 4\n\n    Remove the bowl from the mixer, and use a rubber spatula to fold in\n    the dry ingredients until well combined. Make sure to scrape the\n    bottom and sides of the bowl to ensure an evenly mixed batter.\n\n5.  Step 5\n\n    Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smooth the top and firmly tap\n    the pan on the countertop a few times to release any large air\n    bubbles. Bake the cake until golden and puffed, and a tester\n    inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes.\n\n6.  Step 6\n\n    Set the cake, still in its pan, on a rack to cool for 20 minutes,\n    then use the tip of a knife to loosen the edges and invert the cake\n    onto the rack to cool completely before glazing.\n\n7.  Step 7\n\n    Make the glaze: Once the cake is cool, melt the butter in a saucepan\n    over medium heat. Cook the butter, occasionally scraping the bottom\n    and sides of the pan with a rubber spatula until it turns a deep\n    golden brown and smells nutty. Don’t walk away from the pan during\n    this process. The butter can go from brown and nutty to acrid and\n    burnt in mere moments.\n\n8.  Step 8\n\n    Transfer butter and all the brown bits from the pan to a heat-safe\n    bowl, and let it cool slightly. Whisk in the confectioners’ sugar,\n    maple syrup and salt until smooth. The glaze should be thick but\n    pourable. If it’s too thin, add a bit more confectioners’ sugar. If\n    it’s too thick, add a few drops of water.\n\n9.  Step 9\n\n    Transfer the cake to a serving platter and pour the glaze evenly\n    over the top. Sprinkle with pepitas if desired. Let the glaze set\n    for a few minutes before slicing.\n\nSimilar Recipes\n\n[]\n\n-   \n    [All-in-One Holiday Bundt Cake]\n\n    All-in-One Holiday Bundt Cake\n\n    Julia Moskin\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Pecan Sheet Cake ]\n\n    Pumpkin Pecan Sheet Cake \n\n    Sohla El-Waylly\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Maple Cornbread]\n\n    Pumpkin Maple Cornbread\n\n    Samantha Seneviratne\n-   \n    [Apple Bourbon Bundt Cake]\n\n    Apple Bourbon Bundt Cake\n\n    Melissa Clark\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Oatmeal Cookies]\n\n    Pumpkin Oatmeal Cookies\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Vanilla Bundt Cake]\n\n    Vanilla Bundt Cake\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Crumb Cake]\n\n    Pumpkin Crumb Cake\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Lemon Bundt Cake]\n\n    Lemon Bundt Cake\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Lemon Bundt Cake With Poppy Seeds]\n\n    Lemon Bundt Cake With Poppy Seeds\n\n    Martha Rose Shulman\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Layer Cake With Caramel Buttercream]\n\n    Pumpkin Layer Cake With Caramel Buttercream\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Biscuits With Honey Butter]\n\n    Pumpkin Biscuits With Honey Butter\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Maple Muffins]\n\n    Pumpkin Maple Muffins\n\n    Alison Roman\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Bread With Brown Butter and Bourbon]\n\n    Pumpkin Bread With Brown Butter and Bourbon\n\n    Melissa Clark\n-   \n    [Old-Fashioned Doughnut Bundt Cake]\n\n    Old-Fashioned Doughnut Bundt Cake\n\n    Erin Jeanne McDowell\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Sheet Cake With Molasses Cream-Cheese Frosting]\n\n    Pumpkin Sheet Cake With Molasses Cream-Cheese Frosting\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Spiced Pumpkin Cookie Cake]\n\n    Spiced Pumpkin Cookie Cake\n\n    Jerrelle Guy\n-   \n    [Sour Cream Pound Cake]\n\n    Sour Cream Pound Cake\n\n    Vallery Lomas\n-   \n    [Baked Pumpkin Doughnuts]\n\n    Baked Pumpkin Doughnuts\n\n    Vallery Lomas\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Skillet Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting]\n\n    Pumpkin Skillet Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting\n\n    Erin Jeanne McDowell\n-   \n    [Coffee and Maple Chess Pie]\n\n    Coffee and Maple Chess Pie\n\n    Vaughn Vreeland\n\n[]\n\nRatings\n\n[]\n\n5 out of 5\n\n2,584 user ratings\n\nYour rating\n\n1 star[]2 stars[]3 stars[]4 stars[]5 stars[]\n\nSubmit\n\nLog in or sign up to rate this recipe.\n\nHave you cooked this?\n\n[]Mark as Cooked\n\nLog in or sign up to mark this recipe as cooked.\n\nPrivate Notes\n\nLeave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.\n\nCooking Notes\n\nAdd Note\n\nPublicPrivate\n\nSubmit\n\n-   All Notes\n-   Private\n\nmaustinct7 years ago\n\nThis is a very nice, moist cake - the olive oil recedes and the cardamom\ntakes over in a very pleasant way. I halved the recipe (measured) and\nbaked for 35 minutes in my small bundt pan. I used 2% greek yogurt in\nplace of the sour cream and reduced the brown sugar a bit (200 g). The\nglaze hardens quickly so next time I would add more water. I did saute\nthe pepitas with a tiny bit of oil and tossed them in sugar which made\nthem crunchy and delicious. I will make this again.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 151\n\nmaustinct7 years ago\n\nhalve recipe (200g br sugar); bake for 35 mins.... make glaze runnier\nthan you would think as it hardens pretty much immediately; saute\npepitas in tiny bit of oil and toss in sugar - really good cake\n\nIs this helpful?[] 58\n\ngigiguerra5 years ago\n\nHi. Will someone from the NYT — preferably either the actual baker of\nthe recipe or the food stylist — tell us how to get such a thick, rich\nlooking coating of icing? I’ve made this cake 6 times now (because it\ntastes so darn good) but have never once seen the icing look as it does\nin the publication’s photo.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 57\n\nBill5 years ago\n\nI just gave this a go, pretty much following the recipe with the\nrecommended thinning of the glaze a bit. The only other change was\ndusting the bundt pan with sugar and not flour. Really amazing fall feel\nto it. Taking time to properly brown the butter adds a complexity to the\nglaze that complements the pumpkin cake so well. Neighbors loved it and\nmore importantly my wife did. I might bump the spices up a bit next time\nout, but this is a keeper.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 49\n\nErin C.7 years ago\n\nThis cake is amazing! Super moist. And oh my god the frosting is to DIE\nfor. I did have to add a few drops of water to make it spread easier.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 40\n\nNancy6 years ago\n\nSince I prefer weight to volume especially when baking, I measured the\nbrown sugar both ways because it seemed like a lot. I came up with 2\ncups packed was 346 grams, not 440 grams. I find when I convert to\nweights I often double check between weights and volume. They often do\nnot jibe in fact it's kind of like Celebrity Net Worth - untethered.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 33\n\nnancys5 years ago\n\nThis bundt got rave reviews at thanksgiving. Did a few subs just because\nI didn’t have all ingredients. Used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream,\nadded cloves and ground ginger in place of allspice and used dark brown\nsugar. Cut confectioners sugar in icing by half and it was perfect.\nWould definitely make again and the cardamom and black pepper gave it a\ngreat depth of flavor and warmth. Moist, delicious and not too sweet.\nHave already been asked to make it again.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 26\n\nsbsidhu3 years ago\n\nSince my dad is gluten intolerant, I replaced the all purpose flour with\nbob’s red mill 1 to 1 baking flour (in the blue bag)*. Cake was\ndelicious and no one could tell it was gluten free. *Do NOT confuse with\nbob’s red mill gluten free all purpose flour. They are not the same.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 26\n\nJill1 year ago\n\nMy family and friends loved this cake a couple weeks ago. But everyone\nwanted a bit of glaze in every bite, which you don’t get with a glazed\nBundt cake. So round two was made in a 9x13 pan. It took less time in\nthe oven (can’t recall the exact adjustment for time) and I doubled the\nglaze to cover the whole top of the sheet cake. Toasted pepitas are a\nmust. The second cake this weekend was an even bigger hit with my\nguests. Perfect fall dessert.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 24\n\nTriciaPDX6 years ago\n\nCakes have been made for a lot longer than there has been electricity!\nOf course you can do it with a hand held, too. You can even make it\nwithout a stand or hand mixer by beating the heck out of everything with\na wooden spoon followed by a sturdy whisk. It's just more work to get\neverything creamed and fluffy.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 20\n\nZach C3 years ago\n\nI used 2% Greek yogurt in place of sour cream, and the cake was\nabsolutely perfect. I learned a lesson about blindly following others'\nadvice: I added just a little water to the glaze, but that made it way\ntoo thin and it all ran right off. I used organic powdered sugar, which\ndoesn't contain cornstarch, and I think that was the difference. Water\nmay be more helpful if using conventional powdered sugar with\ncornstarch.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 20\n\nRM606577 years ago\n\nDelicious, show-stopping cake! Served for brunch and it was a hit. The\nbrown butter adds real depth and the pepitas shouldn’t be skipped. This\nwill definitely be a fall tradition.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 15\n\nJen2 years ago\n\nI had excellent results while following the recipe although I had to use\nhalf olive oil and half vegetable oil as my evoo was running low. THE\nGLAZE: had no trouble getting mine to look identical to the photo\ndepicted here. I zapped in microwave for a few seconds prior to glazing\nthe cake. You need to act fast with powdered sugar glazes otherwise they\nharden and make it impossible to get that beautiful drip. Used toasted\nand chopped pecans for finishing. So good!\n\nIs this helpful?[] 13\n\nAuntie Connie5 years ago\n\nI made it exactly as written and agree that it's a beautiful cake. My\nhusband and guests loved it, but I confess to not caring for it very\nmuch. That surprised me because these are flavors I usually love.\nPerhaps boosting the quantity of spices would make me happier, so if I\nmake it again, I'll give that a try. I love the idea of using maple\nsyrup in the frosting, and will probably try that on other cakes I like\nmore.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 12\n\nBill5 years ago\n\nI cooled mine 20 minutes and it came right out. I don't have Nordic Ware\nthough. I well buttered the pan and sprinkled with granulated sugar. The\npan was not warm to the touch after 20 minutes but if anything it came\nout too easily.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 12\n\nLK22 hours ago\n\nReally excellent cake! My five-year-old, who prefers chocolate anything,\nrequests this for breakfast every day. But is a knife to release the\ncake essential? Aren't most Bundts nonstick? I scratched the coating on\nmine; probably should have tried first to release without the knife.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nTenor21 hours ago\n\nAbout halfway through the baking process I discovered that my oven temp\nwas 165 degrees. I turned off the oven, reset the temp, guessed at the\nremaining time, and pulled out the cake when a toothpick came out clean.\nThen put some yams in the oven. Fifteen minutes later my apartment was\nsuddenly filling up with smoke. I turned off the oven and ran to get my\ndoorman. He discovered a flaming potholder in with the yams, pulled it\nout with his bare hands and threw it in the sink. Meanwhile the cake was\nstill on the cooling rack minding its own business despite the very\ndense smoke. I opened every window and went to do laundry because the\nair was unbreathable. Two hours later I returned, calmed myself down,\nand cautiously toasted the pepitas and made the glaze. After glazing the\ncake I had to taste test before bringing it in to work to make sure it\ndidn’t taste like ashes. Delicious! and in a nutshell, indestructible.\nMy doorman will be handsomely rewarded for saving the day.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 1\n\nMary4 days ago\n\nCan anyone suggest an egg substitute for this cake?
