### Pressure Cooker Mushroom and Wild Rice Soup

#### Ingredients
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/2 stick)
- 1 yellow or red onion, minced
- 2 pounds mixed mushrooms (cremini and shiitake), tough stems removed, chopped into 1/2-1 inch pieces
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 2 celery stalks, chopped
- 1 large carrot, peeled and chopped
- 6 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 5 cups vegetable or chicken stock
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 1 cup wild rice (about 6 ounces)
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- Chopped scallions or chives and fresh dill, for topping

#### Steps
1. Turn on sauté setting on 6-8 quart pressure cooker. Melt butter, add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.

2. Add mushrooms and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook until mushrooms release liquid and shrink, about 8 minutes. Add celery, carrot, garlic, thyme, garlic powder and black pepper. Stir in flour until vegetables are evenly coated.

3. Pour in stock and wine, turn off heat. Scrape bottom thoroughly to incorporate flour and browned bits. Stir in wild rice.

4. Cook on high pressure for 10-12 minutes. Let pressure reduce naturally for 10 minutes, then release remaining pressure manually.

5. Check rice texture; if needed, pressure cook additional 2 minutes with quick release. For thicker soup, simmer using sauté function until desired consistency.

6. Whisk sour cream with a few spoonfuls of warm soup in small bowl until smooth, then stir into soup. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

7. Serve topped with scallions/chives and dill. Reheat leftovers on low (boiling can break the sour cream).

Note: Can substitute wine with 1/4 cup additional stock plus 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar or lemon juice.

### Delicata Squash and Sage Biscuits

#### Ingredients
- 1 medium-small delicata squash (½ cup squash purée)
- 2 cups unbleached white flour
- 2 ½ tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp baking soda
- 2 Tbsp cane sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 6 Tbsp unsalted butter, chilled
- 1 small bunch of fresh sage (1 ½ tsp chopped and 10 whole leaves for garnish)
- ¾ cup heavy cream

For the egg wash:
- 1 small egg
- 1 Tbsp milk

#### Steps
1. Slice the delicata squash in half, lengthwise. Remove seeds and stringy pulp. Place cut-side down on a baking sheet. Roast at 400°F for about 30 minutes or until tender. Let cool, scoop out flesh, and mash to make ½ cup purée. Chill in fridge.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Grate the cold butter into the flour mixture. Place in freezer for 5-10 minutes.

3. In another bowl, mix chilled cream, squash purée, and finely chopped sage until smooth. In a separate small bowl, make egg wash by beating egg and milk together.

4. Remove dry ingredients from freezer. Use a pastry cutter or hands to incorporate grated butter into flour until it resembles bread crumbs. Gently add squash-cream mixture, stirring just until dough comes together. Lightly knead in bowl until uniform, avoiding overhandling.

5. On a floured surface, roll or press dough to ¾ inch thickness. Cut with 2½ inch round or square cookie cutter. Brush tops with egg wash and press a sage leaf on each biscuit. Place on buttered baking sheet. Bake at 400°F for 12-15 minutes until golden. Transfer to cooling rack and serve warm.

Yield: 10-12 biscuits


### Green Beans With Ginger and Garlic

#### Ingredients
- 2½ pounds green beans (slim haricots verts work especially well), trimmed
- 4 tablespoons vegetable oil
- ¼ cup minced fresh ginger (from 6 inches peeled ginger root)
- 4 medium garlic cloves, minced
- Salt

#### Steps
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and fill a large bowl with ice water. Working in two batches, boil beans until just tender but still crisp and bright green. Start testing after 4 minutes or so, being careful not to overcook. When done, plunge beans into ice water to stop cooking, lift out immediately when cool and drain on towels. (Recipe can be made to this point up to a day in advance and kept refrigerated, wrapped in towels.)

2. When ready to cook, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wide skillet over high heat. Add half the beans, half the ginger and half the garlic, and cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until beans are heated through and ginger and garlic are softened and aromatic. Sprinkle with salt, and remove to a serving dish. Repeat with remaining oil, beans, ginger and garlic. Serve.

Note: Recipe yields 10 servings and takes approximately 20 minutes to prepare.

### Tahini Apple Tart

#### Ingredients

For the Dough:
- 1½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1¼ teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
- ¾ cup/170 grams unsalted butter, cut into small cubes, chilled
- Ice water, as needed

For the Sesame Spread:
- ⅓ cup tahini
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 large egg
- ¼ teaspoon kosher salt

For the Filling and Assembly:
- 2 pounds crisp, tart apples such as Honeycrisp or Pink Lady (about 6 medium apples)
- 1 tablespoon cider vinegar or lemon juice
- 3 tablespoons sugar, plus more for sprinkling
- 1 teaspoon ground cardamom
- Heavy cream, for brushing
- 1 to 2 tablespoons white sesame seeds
- Vanilla ice cream, whipped cream or crème fraîche, for serving

#### Steps

1. For the Dough: Whisk together the flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add the cold butter and toss until coated in flour mixture, separating any pieces that stick together. Use your fingers to smush and flatten each piece once.

2. Drizzle ¼ cup ice water over the flour mixture. Repeatedly run your fingers through the mixture until combined. The dough will start out looking dry then become very shaggy. Transfer to a clean work surface and knead the dough together into a ball with no dry spots. Add more ice water if needed, 1-2 tablespoons at a time.

3. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and flatten into a 1-inch thick disc. Chill for 2 hours or up to 3 days.

4. Roll out chilled dough on a lightly floured surface into a 14-inch round. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet and refrigerate while making filling.

5. For the sesame spread: Whisk tahini, sugar, butter, egg and salt together until smooth.

6. For the filling: Heat oven to 375°F. Peel, core and thinly slice the apples. Toss with vinegar, sugar and cardamom until sugar dissolves.

7. Remove dough from fridge. Spread sesame mixture in center, leaving 2-inch border. Arrange apples on top. Fold edges over apples, brush with cream and sprinkle with sesame seeds and sugar.

8. Bake on bottom rack 40-50 minutes until crust is deeply golden and apples are tender. Cool 20 minutes before serving with topping of choice.


### Pumpkin Bundt Cake With Maple Brown-Butter Glaze

#### Ingredients

For the Cake:
- 3 cups/384 grams all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1¼ teaspoons kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1½ teaspoons ground cardamom
- ¼ teaspoon ground allspice
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 cups/440 grams light brown sugar, packed
- ½ cup/114 grams unsalted butter, soft but cool

- 1 (15-ounce) can/425 grams pumpkin purée
- ½ cup sour cream

For the Glaze:
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 cup/102 grams confectioners' sugar (preferably organic), sifted
- ¼ cup maple syrup
- Pinch of salt
- 1 to 2 tablespoons lightly toasted pepitas (optional)

#### Steps

1. Heat oven to 350 degrees, and butter and flour a 12-cup (or larger) capacity bundt pan.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, allspice and black pepper until well combined.

3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine brown sugar, butter and olive oil. Beat on medium-high until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, mixing for about 20 seconds between each. Add pumpkin purée and sour cream, mixing until well combined, scraping bowl as needed.

4. Remove bowl from mixer and fold in dry ingredients with a rubber spatula until well combined. Ensure even mixing by scraping bottom and sides of bowl.

5. Pour batter into prepared pan, smooth top and tap pan firmly on counter several times to release air bubbles. Bake until golden and puffed, and a tester comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes.

6. Cool cake in pan on rack for 20 minutes, then loosen edges with knife and invert onto rack to cool completely before glazing.

7. For the glaze: Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat. Cook, occasionally scraping pan, until butter turns deep golden brown and smells nutty. Watch carefully as it can burn quickly.

8. Transfer browned butter and bits to heat-safe bowl to cool slightly. Whisk in confectioners' sugar, maple syrup and salt until smooth. Adjust consistency with more sugar or water as needed.

9. Transfer cake to serving platter, pour glaze evenly over top, and sprinkle with pepitas if desired. Let glaze set before slicing.

### Homemade Cranberry Sauce

#### Ingredients
- 1 12-ounce bag fresh or thawed frozen cranberries
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 3/4 cup orange juice, preferably fresh squeezed
- Zest of 1 orange, or to taste

#### Steps
1. Place cranberries in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and pour over these the sugar and orange juice. Stir to combine.

2. Cook until sugar is entirely melted and cranberries begin to burst in the heat, 4 to 6 minutes. Stir again, add zest, and cook for 2 or 3 minutes longer, turn off heat, cover pan, and allow to cool.

3. Put cranberry mixture in a serving bowl, cover, and place in refrigerator until cold, at least 2 hours, or until you need it.

Note: Cranberry sauce should be sweet but not cloying, and tart without causing pucker and anguish. It should have a jelly-like quality, but should owe more to the appearance of jam. The key element is understanding that cranberries are high in pectin, which is released when heated and helps create the gel-like consistency when combined with sugar.

Yield: About 2 cups
Total Time: 10 minutes (plus chilling time)


### Herbed Gravy

#### Ingredients
- Pan drippings from roasted turkey
- 4 cups turkey or chicken stock
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
- 2 tablespoons fresh sage, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped
- Salt and black pepper to taste

#### Steps
1. After roasting turkey, pour pan drippings into a fat separator or remove excess fat with a spoon.

2. In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.

3. Add flour and whisk constantly for 2-3 minutes to make a roux.

4. Gradually add turkey drippings and stock while whisking continuously to prevent lumps.

5. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until thickened.

6. Add fresh herbs and continue cooking for 2-3 minutes.

7. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

8. Strain if desired for a smoother consistency.

#### Tips
- For extra flavor, add finely diced onions to the roux
- Make ahead using stock and add drippings when turkey is done
- Keep warm in a covered container until ready to serve

Serve hot over turkey, mashed potatoes, or stuffing.

Use any variety of mushrooms you like: Cremini (also called baby bella) are affordable and easy to find and work well, or you can add shiitake or oyster mushrooms for a mix of texture and flavors. Don’t worry about removing small, supple stems, but discard any that are tough or dried-out. Wild rice isn’t a true rice at all but the seed of a grass that’s native to North America. When it’s cooked, it should be pleasantly chewy and nutty, not hard, and most of the grains should be slightly split open to reveal their creamy insides.\",\n  \"author\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Person\",\n    \"name\": \"Sarah DiGregorio\"\n  },\n  \"image\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/23/dining/sd-mushroom-soup/sd-mushroom-soup-square640.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/23/dining/sd-mushroom-soup/sd-mushroom-soup-square640.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 640,\n      \"width\": 640,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/23/dining/sd-mushroom-soup/sd-mushroom-soup-superJumbo.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/23/dining/sd-mushroom-soup/sd-mushroom-soup-superJumbo.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 1497,\n      \"width\": 2048,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/23/dining/sd-mushroom-soup/sd-mushroom-soup-videoSmall.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/23/dining/sd-mushroom-soup/sd-mushroom-soup-videoSmall.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 281,\n      \"width\": 500,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/23/dining/sd-mushroom-soup/sd-mushroom-soup-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/23/dining/sd-mushroom-soup/sd-mushroom-soup-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 1103,\n      \"width\": 735,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"totalTime\": \"PT1H\",\n  \"recipeYield\": \"6 to 8 servings\",\n  \"recipeCuisine\": \"american\",\n  \"recipeCategory\": \"dinner, lunch, weeknight, main course\",\n  \"keywords\": \"dry white wine, instant pot, mushroom, soup, sour cream, wild rice, vegetarian\",\n  \"aggregateRating\": {\n    \"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n    \"ratingValue\": 5,\n    \"ratingCount\": 3122\n  },\n  \"nutrition\": {\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"NutritionInformation\",\n    \"calories\": 280,\n    \"unsaturatedFatContent\": \"4 grams\",\n    \"carbohydrateContent\": \"33 grams\",\n    \"cholesterolContent\": null,\n    \"fatContent\": \"11 grams\",\n    \"fiberContent\": \"4 grams\",\n    \"proteinContent\": \"12 grams\",\n    \"saturatedFatContent\": \"6 grams\",\n    \"sodiumContent\": \"847 milligrams\",\n    \"sugarContent\": \"7 grams\",\n    \"transFatContent\": \"0 grams\"\n  },\n  \"recipeIngredient\": [\n    \"4 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/2 stick)\",\n    \"1 yellow or red onion, minced\",\n    \"2 pounds mixed mushrooms (such as cremini and shiitake), tough stems removed, mushrooms chopped into 1/2- to 1-inch pieces\",\n    \"Kosher salt and black pepper\",\n    \"2 celery stalks, chopped\",\n    \"1 large carrot, peeled and chopped\",\n    \"6 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped\",\n    \"3 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme\",\n    \"1 teaspoon garlic powder\",\n    \"1/4 cup all-purpose flour\",\n    \"5 cups vegetable or chicken stock\",\n    \"1/2 cup dry white wine (see Tip)\",\n    \"1 cup wild rice (about 6 ounces)\",\n    \"1/2 cup sour cream\",\n    \"Chopped scallions or chives and fresh dill, for topping\"\n  ],\n  \"recipeInstructions\": [\n    {\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"HowToStep\",\n      \"text\": \"Turn on the sauté setting on a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure cooker.

Food Stylist: Simon Andrews.\n\nTotal Time\n    About 1 hour\n\nRating\n    5[][][][][](3,122)\n\nNotes\n    Read community notes[]\n\nThis comforting soup tastes long-simmered, but it’s cooked in a pressure\ncooker, which makes it a weeknight possibility (though you could also\nmake this recipe in a slow cooker). Use any variety of mushrooms you\nlike: Cremini (also called baby bella) are affordable and easy to find\nand work well, or you can add shiitake or oyster mushrooms for a mix of\ntexture and flavors. Don’t worry about removing small, supple stems, but\ndiscard any that are tough or dried-out. Wild rice isn’t a true rice at\nall but the seed of a grass that’s native to North America. When it’s\ncooked, it should be pleasantly chewy and nutty, not hard, and most of\nthe grains should be slightly split open to reveal their creamy insides.\n\nRead More\n\n-   []Save\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   []Give\n    Subscriber benefit: give recipes to anyone\n\n    As a subscriber, you have 10 gift recipes to give each month.

Step 1\n\n    Turn on the sauté setting on a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure\n    cooker. Melt the butter, then add the onion. Cook, stirring\n    occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes.\n\n2.  Step 2\n\n    Add the mushrooms and 1 teaspoon salt, and cook, stirring\n    occasionally, until the mushrooms have released their liquid and\n    shrunk a bit, about 8 minutes. Add the celery, carrot, chopped\n    garlic, thyme, garlic powder and several generous grinds of black\n    pepper. Stir to combine. Add the flour and stir until the vegetables\n    are evenly coated and no white spots remain.\n\n3.  Step 3\n\n    Pour in the stock and wine, and turn off the heat. Scrape the bottom\n    of the pot very well to incorporate flour and any browned bits that\n    are stuck to the bottom. (This will add flavor and also prevent a\n    burn warning later.) Stir in the wild rice.\n\n4.  Step 4\n\n    Cook on high pressure for 10 to 12 minutes. Turn off the heat and\n    let the pressure reduce naturally for 10 minutes, then release the\n    remaining pressure manually.\n\n5.  Step 5\n\n    Stir the soup and check the texture of the wild rice; if it needs a\n    bit more time repeat the pressure cooking process for a cook time of\n    2 minutes and rapidly release the pressure. Check the texture of the\n    soup; if you’d like it to be thicker, turn on the sauté function and\n    let the soup simmer to reduce to desired consistency. Turn off the\n    heat.\n\n6.  Step 6\n\n    Put the sour cream in a small bowl and slowly whisk in a few\n    spoonfuls of warm soup until smooth, then stir the mixture into the\n    soup. (This prevents the sour cream from separating.) Taste the soup\n    and add salt and pepper to taste.\n\n7.  Step 7\n\n    Serve the soup in bowls topped with chopped scallions or chives and\n    dill. Reheat any leftovers on low until warm. (Boiling can cause the\n    sour cream to break.)\n\nTip\n\n-   If you prefer to cook without wine, instead add ¼ cup more water or\n    stock and 2 teaspoons of white wine vinegar or lemon juice.\n\nSimilar Recipes\n\n[]\n\n-   \n    [Slow Cooker Mushroom and Wild Rice Soup]\n\n    Slow Cooker Mushroom and Wild Rice Soup\n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n-   \n    [Slow-Cooker Beef and Barley Soup]\n\n    Slow-Cooker Beef and Barley Soup\n\n    Ali Slagle\n-   \n    [One-Pot Mushroom and Ginger Rice]\n\n    One-Pot Mushroom and Ginger Rice\n\n    Hetty Lui McKinnon\n-   \n    [Wild Rice and Mushroom Casserole]\n\n    Wild Rice and Mushroom Casserole\n\n    Melissa Clark\n-   \n    [Mushroom Risotto With Peas]\n\n    Mushroom Risotto With Peas\n\n    Martha Rose Shulman\n-   \n    [Wild Rice and Mushroom Soup]\n\n    Wild Rice and Mushroom Soup\n\n    Martha Rose Shulman\n-   \n    [Mushroom Barley Soup]\n\n    Mushroom Barley Soup\n\n    Dawn Lerman\n-   \n    [Pressure Cooker Chicken Soup With Lemon and Rice]\n\n    Pressure Cooker Chicken Soup With Lemon and Rice\n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n-   \n    [Mushroom-Barley Soup]\n\n    Mushroom-Barley Soup\n\n    Mark Bittman\n-   \n    [Miso-Mushroom Barley Soup]\n\n    Miso-Mushroom Barley Soup\n\n    Yasmin Fahr\n-   \n    [Wild Rice Dressing With Mushrooms and Chile Crisp]\n\n    Wild Rice Dressing With Mushrooms and Chile Crisp\n\n    Nik Sharma\n-   \n    [Fresh and Wild Mushroom Stew]\n\n    Fresh and Wild Mushroom Stew\n\n    David Tanis\n-   \n    [Pressure Cooker Porcini Risotto]\n\n    Pressure Cooker Porcini Risotto\n\n    Mark Bittman\n-   \n    [Mushroom Soup]\n\n    Mushroom Soup\n\n    Mark Bittman\n-   \n    [Wild Rice With Mushrooms]\n\n    Wild Rice With Mushrooms\n\n    Ligaya Mishan\n-   \n    [Slow-Cooker Cauliflower, Potato and White Bean Soup]\n\n    Slow-Cooker Cauliflower, Potato and White Bean Soup\n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n-   \n    [Instant Pot Mushroom and Potato Paprikash ]\n\n    Instant Pot Mushroom and Potato Paprikash \n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n-   \n    [Wild Mushroom Soup]\n\n    Wild Mushroom Soup\n\n    Jeff Gordinier\n-   \n    [Pressure Cooker Lentil Soup With Sausage]\n\n    Pressure Cooker Lentil Soup With Sausage\n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n-   \n    [Pressure Cooker White Bean-Parmesan Soup]\n\n    Pressure Cooker White Bean-Parmesan Soup\n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n\n[]\n\nRatings\n\n[]\n\n5 out of 5\n\n3,122 user ratings\n\nYour rating\n\n1 star[]2 stars[]3 stars[]4 stars[]5 stars[]\n\nSubmit\n\nLog in or sign up to rate this recipe.\n\nHave you cooked this?\n\n[]Mark as Cooked\n\nLog in or sign up to mark this recipe as cooked.\n\nPrivate Notes\n\nLeave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.\n\nCooking Notes\n\nAdd Note\n\nPublicPrivate\n\nSubmit\n\n-   All Notes\n-   Private\n\nHope3 years ago\n\nTo make without pressure or slow cooker: Once you've stirred in the wild\nrice at the end of step 3, simmer the soup covered until the rice is\ncooked.

Add sautéed veggies\nto slow cooker with rest of ingredients (except cream and garnish). Cook\non low for 8 hours of on high for 6 hours. Check in to ensure sufficient\nliquid occasionally. When wild rice cracks open so you can see the\nlighter color inside, it’s ready.

I had to add 3 additional\ncups of chicken broth after it cooked to get more of a soup consistency.\nThe flavor was okay. I served this to guests who claimed to like it but\nI have to wonder if they were being polite. Wouldn’t make again.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nAnjali6 days ago\n\nObsessed. It is super comforting while not too heavy. My advice: - My\npersonal principle is to not waste stock on pressure cooker recipes.\nJust use water. It will become stock in there anyways. - Wild rice is\nhard to find around here. I used the quick cooking farro from Trader\nJoe's. The 10 min cook time in this recipe yields perfect texture.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nSarah1 week ago\n\nI replaced half the broth with the liquid from soaking some dried\nboletas and porcini mushrooms.

Instead, I put a\ndollop of sour cream in each serving and mixed it.

Tasty!\n\nIs this helpful?[] 1\n\nC5 months ago\n\nDelicious soup recipe! Changes I made: used half the butter and added\nolive oil. Added rehydrated mushroom mix for some extra umami. Followed\nthe wine substitution method but instead of using broth, added the water\nused to soak dehydrated mushrooms. Topped the soup with truffle oil.\nChanges for next time: more rice to add bulk (possibly 1.5 cups)\nDefinitely not a quick weeknight dinner recipe. 1 hour cook time is\naccurate. But good for meal prep and I think has excellent ROI.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 1\n\nMary6 months ago\n\nI just cooked this soup and it’s delicious. I prepared the soup on my\nstove top. Cooked the brown rice/wild rice combination in a separate pot\nwith chicken stock. Cooked all the other ingredients in my large stock\npot separately. I did add butter that was already mixed with white miso\nfrom my refrigerator.. I would serve this with crispy toasted baguettes\nI just cookedand a Caesar salad on the side. I couldn’t be more pleased\nwith this dish. I’m sure that it freezes well. this soup is a winner\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nFaye7 months ago\n\nRice no where near cooked at 12 mins. Put in for another 8 mins. Still\nquite chewy - I know it's supposed to be somewhat, but I probably would\nadd more stock and pressure cook for 20 mins in future. Perhaps I'm less\nadept at chopping, but I wouldn't consider this a week night dish.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nKate8 months ago\n\nThis made a delicious soup! Not the biggest garlic fan for soups, so I\nreduced to 4 garlic cloves and scratched the garlic powder. Added 2 bay\nleaves. The 6 qt instant pot is not big enough to accommodate all the\nmushrooms that this recipe calls for. It can fit 1.5 lbs of mushrooms, 2\nlbs was a bit too ambitious.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nDrake Baer9 months ago\n\nManzanilla instead of red wine. Triple the thyme. Additional butter at\nthe end instead of sour cream. I found the sour cream muddled the\nexquisite taste of the shrooms, butter and sherry. As written, this\ndoesn’t quite work as vegetarian stroganoff.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nErika9 months ago\n\nSo good! Leftovers were excellent too. Easily cooked on the stove-top in\na Dutch oven with slight modification. I added 2 stalks of leeks, as\nthey seemed fitting. I put the firmer vegetables in after the onion to\ncook down and sweat, then put all of the mushrooms in until they shrunk\ntoo. I added the broth, wild rice, etc as directed and let it simmer for\n~45min. Then sour cream, etc. The textures were all perfect that way.\nJust test the rice here and there to taste when it's done.

I checked doneness at 350 @ 45 minutes and it was at 155 but looked undone so I added 15 more minutes and temp was up to 165 and was cooked through.  I covered the turkey and let it rest.  The wings had a nice and crispy skin as did the breast but the legs were not that crispy.  Best of all, no basting needed.

For the turkey: Four days before service, place the salt, sage,\n    thyme, black peppercorns, and allspice into a spice grinder and\n    pulse until the peppercorns and allspice are coarsely ground, 5 to 6\n    pulses. Set aside. \n2.  Set the turkey, breast-side down, on a large cutting board with the\n    tail closest to you. Use an electric knife or heavy-duty kitchen\n    shears to cut up one side of the backbone. Turn the bird around and\n    cut back down the other side of the spine. Reserve the backbone for\n    Giblet Stock. Discard any fat pockets or excess skin found inside\n    the turkey. Turn the turkey breast-side up and use the heel of your\n    hands to press down on both breasts, until you hear a cracking sound\n    and the bird has flattened slightly. \n3.  Rub the seasoned salt on both sides of the turkey. Place the turkey\n    on a parchment paper lined half sheet pan, breast-side up with legs\n    running with the long side of the pan. Store, uncovered, in the\n    refrigerator for 4 days. \n4.  Remove the turkey from the refrigerator and leave at room\n    temperature for 1 hour. \n5.  For the panzanella: Place the parsnips and rutabaga in a large\n    nonstick roasting pan, toss with vegetable oil and set aside. \n6.  Place one rack in the middle of the oven and a second one far enough\n    below so the roasting pan will fit. Heat the oven to 425 degrees F.\n    Place the turkey directly on the middle rack of the oven with the\n    legs perpendicular to the metal bars of the rack. \n7.  Place the roasting pan with the parsnips and rutabaga on the rack\n    below the turkey and roast both for 30 minutes. \n8.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. Add the red onion to the roasting\n    vegetables and stir to combine. Continue to roast both the\n    vegetables and the turkey until a probe thermometer inserted into\n    the thickest part of the breast registers 155 degrees F, an\n    additional 40 to 50 minutes.\n9.  Remove the turkey from the oven onto a cooling rack set inside a\n    half sheet pan and rest for 30 minutes. \n10. Add the Brussels sprouts, bread cubes and garlic to the roasting\n    vegetables, stir to combine and roast for an additional 15 minutes.\n    Remove the vegetables from the oven and immediately transfer to a\n    serving bowl. Pour the apple cider vinegar in the warm roasting pan,\n    stir and scrape off any browned bits from the pan. Pour the vinegar\n    mixture over the salad, add the thyme and toss to combine. Season\n    with salt and pepper as desired. Serve warm or at room temperature. \n11. Carve the turkey with an electric knife and serve with the\n    panzanella.\n\nTools You May Need\n\nPrice and stock may change after publish date, and we may make money off\nthese links.\n\nTools You May Need\n\nPrice and stock may change after publish date, and we may make money off\nthese links.\n\nMy Private Notes\n\n[] Add a Note\n\n[] WATCH []\n\nShow: Good Eats\n\nEpisode: Alton's Countdown to T-Day\n\nCategories:\n\nThanksgiving Turkey Poultry Thanksgiving Turkey Recipes Brined Turkey\nRoasted Turkey Roasting Main Dish High Fiber\n\nMore from:\n\nTop Turkeys for Thanksgiving\n\nLooking for Something Else?\n\nQuick & Easy More Turkey Recipes 5 Ingredients or Less Highly Rated\n\n[]\n\nDry-Brined Roasted Turkey\n\n[]\n\nDry-Brined Herbed Turkey\n\n[Jeff Mauro Fried Turkey, as seen on The Kitchen Thanksgiving Live,\nSpecial 1]\n\nDry-Brined Fried Turkey\n\n[]\n\nButterflied Juniper-Brined Roasted Turkey with Compound Butter\n\n👩‍🍳 What's Cooking\n\n[Food Network Kitchen’s Sweet Potato Casserole as seen on Food Network.]\n\nClassic Thanksgiving Sides []\n\n[Juicy Mayo Roasted Turkey]\n\nShowstopping Turkey Recipes []\n\n[Thanksgiving Turkey Cupcakes]\n\nFestive Dessert Ideas []\n\nDiscover More Recipes...\n\nShop With Us\n\n[]\n\n5 Best Vacuum Sealers, Tested and Reviewed\n\n[]\n\n9 Best Air Fryers, Tested and Reviewed\n\n[]\n\n8 Best Coffeemakers, Tested and Reviewed\n\nOur Newsletter\n\nTo sign up, please enable JavaScript.\n\nSign up for the Food Network Shopping Newsletter\n\nBy entering your email address, you agree to our Terms of Use and\nacknowledge the Privacy Policy.

Scoop out the roasted flesh\n    and discard the skins. Mash by hand with a potato masher, or if you\n    wish, purée with a hand blender until smooth. Measure out 1/2 cup of\n    squash purée. Chill the purée in the fridge.\n\n2.  2\n\n    In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and\n    baking soda. Using a box grater, grate the cold butter into the\n    flour mixture. Place this mixture in the freezer while you prepare\n    the wet ingredients (about 5 to 10 minutes).\n\n3.  3\n\n    In another bowl, mix the chilled cream, squash purée, and finely\n    chopped sage. Whisk together until smooth. In another smaller bowl,\n    make the egg wash by beating the egg and 1 Tbsp. of milk together.\n\n4.  4\n\n    Remove the dry ingredients from the freezer. With a pastry cutter or\n    your hands, make sure the grated butter is fully incorporated into\n    the flour (it should look like bread crumbs). Gently add the squash\n    and cream mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring just until the\n    dough starts to come together. Using your hands, lightly knead the\n    dough in the bowl, until uniform, but avoiding overhandling it.\n\n5.  5\n\n    Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour and either roll or\n    simply press the dough out to 3/4 inch thickness. Using a 2 1/2 inch\n    round or square cookie cutter, cut out the biscuits. Brush the tops\n    with egg wash and gently press a whole sage leaf on top of each\n    biscuit. Place on a lightly buttered baking sheet. Bake for 12 to 15\n    minutes in a 400F oven, until golden on top. Transfer the biscuits\n    to a cooling rack and serve warm.\n\nPin Us!\n\nI am on a full-out squash kick lately. After last week's roasted squash\ncrème brûlée, I hope you'll indulge me in one more squash recipe. This\none brings together the sweetness of delicata squash and the festive\nflavour of fresh sage in a tender buttery biscuit. The squash gives a\nlovely golden hue to these biscuits which are flecked with tiny pieces\nof chopped sage.\n\nSquash and sage make a mighty tasty pair, it must be said. Delicata is a\nlesser-known squash, though I don't understand why because in my\nopinion, its flavor and texture is unparalleled. It's well-worth seeking\nit out and getting acquainted with it!\n\nIt also goes by the name of sweet potato squash and it is rich, sweet,\nand creamy.\n\nThis recipe is inspired by the sweet potato biscuits in Kinfolk's new\ncookbook, The Kinfolk Table, which is a delightful visual feast, packed\nwith enticing recipes. Since I had plenty of delicatas on hand, I\nthought I would use them instead of the sweet potato and add a little\nfresh sage to make a Thanksgiving-themed biscuit that is a great\naccompaniment to a seasonal soup or festive dinner. I also followed some\nuseful biscuit-making tips from my fellow PBS Food blogger, Adrianna of\nA Cozy Kitchen, who is an expert biscuit-baker.\n\nI'm quite certain these biscuits would be equally delicious if made with\nanother variety of squash, or sweet potato. But if you can get your\nhands on some delicata squash, I do recommend it.

Step 1\n\n    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and fill a large bowl\n    with ice water. Working in two batches, boil beans until just tender\n    but still crisp and bright green. Start testing after 4 minutes or\n    so, being careful not to overcook. When done, plunge beans into ice\n    water to stop cooking, lift out immediately when cool and drain on\n    towels. (Recipe can be made to this point up to a day in advance and\n    kept refrigerated, wrapped in towels.)\n\n2.  Step 2\n\n    When ready to cook, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wide skillet over\n    high heat. Add half the beans, half the ginger and half the garlic,\n    and cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until beans are heated\n    through and ginger and garlic are softened and aromatic. Sprinkle\n    with salt, and remove to a serving dish. Repeat with remaining oil,\n    beans, ginger and garlic. Serve.\n\nSimilar Recipes\n\n[]\n\n-   \n    [Green Beans With Lime and Red Onions]\n\n    Green Beans With Lime and Red Onions\n\n    Melissa Clark\n-   \n    [Sautéed Green Beans]\n\n    Sautéed Green Beans\n\n    Kia Damon\n-   \n    [Green Beans and Tomatoes]\n\n    Green Beans and Tomatoes\n\n    Millie Peartree\n-   \n    [Crushed Green Bean Salad With Cranberry]\n\n    Crushed Green Bean Salad With Cranberry\n\n    Sohla El-Waylly\n-   \n    [Green Beans With Herbs and Olives]\n\n    Green Beans With Herbs and Olives\n\n    David Tanis\n-   \n    [Pan-Roasted Green Beans With Golden Almonds]\n\n    Pan-Roasted Green Beans With Golden Almonds\n\n    Tara Parker-Pope\n-   \n    [Spicy Black Bean Soup]\n\n    Spicy Black Bean Soup\n\n    Ali Slagle\n-   \n    [Green Beans With Dill]\n\n    Green Beans With Dill\n\n    Amanda Hesser\n-   \n    [Green Bean Salad With Hot Mustard Dressing]\n\n    Green Bean Salad With Hot Mustard Dressing\n\n    Kay Chun\n-   \n    [Rice and Peas]\n\n    Rice and Peas\n\n    Ashley Lonsdale\n-   \n    [Green Bean and Corn Almondine]\n\n    Green Bean and Corn Almondine\n\n    Kay Chun\n-   \n    [French Green Beans and Shallots]\n\n    French Green Beans and Shallots\n\n    Jacques Pepin\n-   \n    [Air-Fryer Green Beans]\n\n    Air-Fryer Green Beans\n\n    Eleanore Park\n-   \n    [Warm Cabbage and Green Beans]\n\n    Warm Cabbage and Green Beans\n\n    Elaine Louie\n-   \n    [Green Beans With Lemon Vinaigrette]\n\n    Green Beans With Lemon Vinaigrette\n\n    Mark Bittman\n-   \n    [Creamy White Beans With Herb Oil]\n\n    Creamy White Beans With Herb Oil\n\n    Colu Henry\n-   \n    [Creamy Braised White Beans]\n\n    Creamy Braised White Beans\n\n    Ali Slagle\n-   \n    [Green Bean Casserole]\n\n    Green Bean Casserole\n\n    Eric Kim\n-   \n    [Bean and Cheese Burritos]\n\n    Bean and Cheese Burritos\n\n    Kay Chun\n-   \n    [Baked Beans With Mint, Peppers and Tomatoes]\n\n    Baked Beans With Mint, Peppers and Tomatoes\n\n    Martha Rose Shulman\n\n[]\n\nRatings\n\n[]\n\n5 out of 5\n\n3,922 user ratings\n\nYour rating\n\n1 star[]2 stars[]3 stars[]4 stars[]5 stars[]\n\nSubmit\n\nLog in or sign up to rate this recipe.\n\nHave you cooked this?\n\n[]Mark as Cooked\n\nLog in or sign up to mark this recipe as cooked.\n\nPrivate Notes\n\nLeave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.\n\nCooking Notes\n\nAdd Note\n\nPublicPrivate\n\nSubmit\n\n-   All Notes\n-   Private\n\nA Mayer7 years ago\n\nI add 1 T of soy sauce and 1 T of White wine vinegar ( or sherry\nvinegar) for a minute, before the ginger and garlic.

Boiling them changes\nthe taste (dilutes the carbohydrates and thus the sweetness) and leaches\nout vitamins and other nutrients. Steaming cooks them more quickly\nbecause steam has a higher temperature than boiling water.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 188\n\nJanet7 years ago\n\nI stop cooking as soon as the color turns bright.

And trying\nit pulling beans out of boil at 2nin 30 sec. If you want snappy crunch,\nlike the restaurant, skip the boiling. Just throw 'em in an iron skillet\nwith olive oil etc and a lid (to keep oil popping all over) and flip a\ncouple times over a couple minutes. To have it somewhere in between do\nnot boil it over 2 minutes... absolute max. I think this recipe was\nwritten for throwing frozen beans straight from tbe freezer into the\npot, not, fresn beans. There really isn't any reason to boil them.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\njohnrf4 months ago\n\nSeems like a lot of ginger root.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nTara D.5 months ago\n\nThis is my new favorite way to cook fresh green beans!

The double dose of sesame is used in both the crust and filling, giving a nutty, earthy pop against the natural sweetness of the apples. They get tossed in ground cardamom for a wonderfully sweet, warm scent. Sesame is used twice: First, it becomes a spreadable paste with tahini, butter, sugar and egg, which becomes almost halva-like when combined with the cardamom-scented apples. Second, sesame seeds (and sugar) get sprinkled along the edges of the tart, making for a strikingly beautiful, textured crust. \",\n  \"author\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Person\",\n    \"name\": \"Andy Baraghani\"\n  },\n  \"image\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-square640.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-square640.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 640,\n      \"width\": 640,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-googleFourByThree.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-googleFourByThree.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 600,\n      \"width\": 800,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-videoSmall.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-videoSmall.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 281,\n      \"width\": 500,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/AB-Apple-and-Tahini-Tart/Sheet-Pan-Chicken-with-Potatoes-and-Arugula-fkbl-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 1103,\n      \"width\": 735,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"prepTime\": \"PT40M\",\n  \"cookTime\": \"PT1H30M\",\n  \"totalTime\": \"PT2H10M\",\n  \"recipeYield\": \"8 servings\",\n  \"recipeCuisine\": \"\",\n  \"recipeCategory\": \"dessert\",\n  \"keywords\": \"apple, cardamom, make-ahead, plan-ahead, sesame seed, tahini, tart, fall, thanksgiving\",\n  \"aggregateRating\": {\n    \"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n    \"ratingValue\": 5,\n    \"ratingCount\": 383\n  },\n  \"recipeIngredient\": [\n    \"1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed \",\n    \"1 tablespoon sugar\",\n    \"1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)\",\n    \"3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter, cut into small cubes, chilled \",\n    \"Ice water, as needed\",\n    \"1/3 cup tahini\",\n    \"3 tablespoons sugar \",\n    \"3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature \",\n    \"1 large egg\",\n    \"1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\",\n    \"2 pounds crisp, tart apples such as Honeycrisp or Pink Lady (about 6 medium apples) \",\n    \"1 tablespoon cider vinegar or lemon juice\",\n    \"3 tablespoons sugar, plus more for sprinkling \",\n    \"1 teaspoon ground cardamom\",\n    \"Heavy cream, for brushing \",\n    \"1 to 2 tablespoons white sesame seeds \",\n    \"Vanilla ice cream, whipped cream or crème fraîche, for serving\"\n  ],\n  \"recipeInstructions\": [\n    {\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"HowToStep\",\n      \"text\": \"For the Dough: Whisk together the flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl.

The sesame filling did turn out bitter for me, so I'm going to see about sourcing a different brand of tahini. The tub I got was freshly opened. I also had to bake for 15-20 minutes longer. But all in all this was a neat twist on an old favorite and I will make it again.\",\n      \"datePublished\": \"2024-11-09T23:47:52.000Z\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Review\",\n      \"author\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Person\",\n        \"name\": \"OB\"\n      },\n      \"reviewBody\": \"I loved this and would make again for sure. \\nAs others have commented, it’s not super sweet. \\nI used Fuji apples, medium sized, I packed them in a tight spiral (almost standing them up in the sticky filling) and used about 4.5 apples).

Food Stylist: Barrett Washburne.\n\nTotal Time\n    2 hours 10 minutes, plus 2 hours’ chilling\n\nPrep Time\n    40 minutes\n\nCook Time\n    1 hour and 30 minutes, plus 2 hours’ chilling\n\nRating\n    5[][][][][](383)\n\nNotes\n    Read community notes[]\n\nIf you’re someone who loves a dessert packed with fruit and texture,\nthis apple tart is made for you. The double dose of sesame is used in\nboth the crust and filling, giving a nutty, earthy pop against the\nnatural sweetness of the apples. They get tossed in ground cardamom for\na wonderfully sweet, warm scent. Sesame is used twice: First, it becomes\na spreadable paste with tahini, butter, sugar and egg, which becomes\nalmost halva-like when combined with the cardamom-scented apples.\nSecond, sesame seeds (and sugar) get sprinkled along the edges of the\ntart, making for a strikingly beautiful, textured crust. \n\nRead More\n\n-   []Save\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   []Give\n    Subscriber benefit: give recipes to anyone\n\n    As a subscriber, you have 10 gift recipes to give each month.

Step 1\n\n    For the Dough: Whisk together the flour, sugar and salt in a large\n    bowl. Dump in the cold butter and toss until coated in the flour\n    mixture, separating any pieces that stick together. Use your fingers\n    to smush and flatten each piece once.\n\n2.  Step 2\n\n    Drizzle ¼ cup ice water over the flour mixture. Repeatedly run your\n    fingers through the mixture, as if rummaging through a drawer, until\n    combined. The dough will start out looking dry then become very\n    shaggy. Transfer to a clean work surface and use your palms to knead\n    the dough together, forming a ball with no dry spots. You may need\n    an additional tablespoon or two of ice water to help the dough come\n    together, but even then it will be shaggy, not smooth or shiny.\n\n3.  Step 3\n\n    Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and use your hands to flatten it\n    into a round disc about 1-inch thick. Chill for 2 hours or up to 3\n    days.\n\n4.  Step 4\n\n    Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour and roll out the dough,\n    turning it to prevent it from sticking between rolls, into a 14-inch\n    round. Gently gather both ends of the dough and transfer to a\n    parchment-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate the dough while you make\n    the sesame spread and apple filling.\n\n5.  Step 5\n\n    For the sesame spread: Whisk the tahini, sugar, butter, egg and salt\n    together in a medium bowl until smooth. (You can make the sesame\n    spread 5 days ahead; just bring to room temperature before using, so\n    it spreads easily.)\n\n6.  Step 6\n\n    For the filling: Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Peel, core and thinly\n    slice the apples (see Tip). Toss the apple slices, vinegar, sugar\n    and the cardamom together in a large bowl until the sugar feels like\n    it has dissolved.\n\n7.  Step 7\n\n    Remove the dough from the fridge and plop the sesame spread in the\n    center. Use the back of a spoon to evenly distribute the sesame\n    spread, leaving a 2-inch border. Arrange the apples on top in\n    whatever manner you like. Fold the edges of the dough over the\n    apples to form the crust, then brush the dough with heavy cream and\n    sprinkle with sesame seeds and more sugar.\n\n8.  Step 8\n\n    Bake on the bottom rack for 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the pan\n    halfway through, until the crust is deeply golden brown and the\n    apples are tender. Let cool for 20 minutes before slicing and\n    serving with the topping of your choice.\n\nTip\n\n-   One efficient way to peel, core and thinly slice apples is to first\n    use a vegetable peeler to remove the peels, starting from the stem\n    end and working your way down to the root end. Then, place the\n    apples upright and, using a chef's knife, cut each apple around its\n    core into three pieces, cutting straight down and slightly rotating\n    the apples between cuts. Slice each piece into thin half-moons.\n\nSimilar Recipes\n\n[]\n\n-   \n    [Sticky Miso Salmon Bowl]\n\n    Sticky Miso Salmon Bowl\n\n    Andy Baraghani\n-   \n    [Maple-Roasted Squash With Charred Lemon]\n\n    Maple-Roasted Squash With Charred Lemon\n\n    Melissa Clark\n-   \n    [Brown Sugar Layer Cake With Cranberry Buttercream]\n\n    Brown Sugar Layer Cake With Cranberry Buttercream\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Nam Prik Ong Lasagna]\n\n    Nam Prik Ong Lasagna\n\n    Khushbu Shah\n-   \n    [Baked Apple Cider Doughnuts]\n\n    Baked Apple Cider Doughnuts\n\n    Erin Jeanne McDowell\n-   \n    [Laminated Pie Dough]\n\n    Laminated Pie Dough\n\n    Vaughn Vreeland\n-   \n    [Butter Swim Biscuits]\n\n    Butter Swim Biscuits\n\n    Naz Deravian\n-   \n    [Potatoes Romanoff]\n\n    Potatoes Romanoff\n\n    Naz Deravian\n-   \n    [Chewy Brownie Cookies]\n\n    Chewy Brownie Cookies\n\n    Vaughn Vreeland\n-   \n    [Christina Tosi’s Corn Bake]\n\n    Christina Tosi’s Corn Bake\n\n    Christina Tosi\n-   \n    [Best Black Bean Soup]\n\n    Best Black Bean Soup\n\n    Julia Moskin\n-   \n    [Spice Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting]\n\n    Spice Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Braised White Beans and Greens With Parmesan]\n\n    Braised White Beans and Greens With Parmesan\n\n    Lidey Heuck\n-   \n    [Ras el Hanout Roasted Vegetables]\n\n    Ras el Hanout Roasted Vegetables\n\n    Nargisse Benkabbou\n-   \n    [Saag Paneer Lasagna]\n\n    Saag Paneer Lasagna\n\n    Khushbu Shah\n-   \n    [Giant Roasted Vegetable Platter]\n\n    Giant Roasted Vegetable Platter\n\n    Melissa Clark\n-   \n    [Cheese Dreams]\n\n    Cheese Dreams\n\n    Melissa Knific\n-   \n    [Butternut Squash Sambar]\n\n    Butternut Squash Sambar\n\n    Naz Deravian\n-   \n    [All-Purpose Biscuits]\n\n    All-Purpose Biscuits\n\n    Sam Sifton\n-   \n    [Loaded Baked Sweet Potatoes]\n\n    Loaded Baked Sweet Potatoes\n\n    Lidey Heuck\n\n[]\n\nRatings\n\n[]\n\n5 out of 5\n\n383 user ratings\n\nYour rating\n\n1 star[]2 stars[]3 stars[]4 stars[]5 stars[]\n\nSubmit\n\nLog in or sign up to rate this recipe.\n\nHave you cooked this?\n\n[]Mark as Cooked\n\nLog in or sign up to mark this recipe as cooked.\n\nPrivate Notes\n\nLeave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.\n\nCooking Notes\n\nAdd Note\n\nPublicPrivate\n\nSubmit\n\n-   All Notes\n-   Private\n\nJudy2 months ago\n\nI used only one tablespoon of sugar in the spread, one tablespoon of\nsugar in the filling, substituted avocado oil for the butter, and used a\npurchased frozen pie shell.

Used a denser golden delicious because the\nhoneycrisp I had seemed too light and airy and maybe too sweet. I think\nthey would have been better as my apples did not cook all the way, so I\nshould have covered the entire top with foil and cooked longer. I used\nfresh cardamom from pods and ground with a mortar and pestle. So good,\nwill definitely make again.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 26\n\nSandy1 month ago\n\n@Cam, if your tahini was bitter it just might be rancid.

A keeper. Nice crust - sesame seeds add flavour. Sliced\napples about 1/8\". Next time will do thinner to optimize how I can\narrange the slices - and I plan to sprinkle sugar on the apples as well\nas the crust. Bake time is listed as 40-50. I started with 40 - not\ngolden. Added 10 min to take it to 50. Still not great. Kept going up by\n5 minutes and took it out at 70 minutes. Now notice that summary at the\ntop says the \"cook time\" is one hour, 30 minutes = 90???\n\nIs this helpful?[] 10\n\nLore Dowell1 week ago\n\nSo the pie is not baked in a pie dish?\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nShawn1 week ago\n\nDefinitely only needs 4 smaller apples or 3 large ones if you're\nplanning to insert the slices in a flower formation. I used a mix of\nhoneycrisp (sweeter) and cosmic crisp (more tart). You may also want to\ntake out the chilled dough for 10 minutes before you're ready to roll it\nout. And if you have a super basic oven like me where things usually\ntake longer, preheat to 400, drop to 375, and bake for 55-60 minutes.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nML1 week ago\n\nI think this is my favorite crust ever! I made it as instructed except\nusing the food processor. So crumbly and buttery!\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nBirdie2 weeks ago\n\nThis turned out very good. I used a storebought rolled pie crust and it\nworked just fine. I only needed four apples to fill it though. I also\nadded a little cinnamon to the apples, since I find cardamom\noverpowering on its own. The sesame filling did turn out bitter for me,\nso I'm going to see about sourcing a different brand of tahini. The tub\nI got was freshly opened. I also had to bake for 15-20 minutes longer.\nBut all in all this was a neat twist on an old favorite and I will make\nit again.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nOB3 weeks ago\n\nI loved this and would make again for sure. As others have commented,\nit’s not super sweet. I used Fuji apples, medium sized, I packed them in\na tight spiral (almost standing them up in the sticky filling) and used\nabout 4.5 apples). In hindsight I suppose I could have made more flat\nlayers to fit in more, but this result was great. Baked around 65\nminutes to match the golden hue of the photo. Filling was perfect,\npastry was on the crunchy side.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nOB3 weeks ago\n\nI used a mandolin to slice, and did not peel the apples. Would do the\nsame way next time!

Cook time ended up at around an hour, but as\nalways this will depend on your oven, your nose and your preferences.\nThis is a winner in my house: the crust shattered beautifully, the\nsesame was present but not overpowering and the cardamom was delightful.\nWill absolutely make again.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nAnna3 weeks ago\n\nThese are some of my favorite ingredients, but the tahini and cardamon\ndon't come together for me in this dish. They almost cancel each other\nout! I'm dismayed but there it is. Trust me, I really wanted to like\nthis, and I tried twice: first with Honeycrisp apples, and second with\nCosmic Crisp apples and extra demerera sugar on top. The crust was\ntasty, and I liked that with the tahini part. I might simply bake that,\ncool it, and fill it with custard and blackberries.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nstacy in the desert4 weeks ago\n\nI use gf crust for pies. Used a store-bought version and should have par\nbaked it first. The crust was soggy from the tahini butter. A 9” pie\ncrust is a little small for 2lbs of apples. But the flavor was sublime!\nI’m not a big cinnamon fan so the tahini butter and cardamom were\nperfect with the apples. Next attempt will be with homemade gf tart\nshell that is par-baked.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nTony4 weeks ago\n\nIt was different, which was good. Not a lot of added sugar was a plus\ntoo. I made it in a deep dish pie plate which contained the apples\nbetter. It needed more like 70 minutes to bake, both to brown the crust\nand for the apples to soften enough. Maybe needed more spices, cinnamon\nand ginger, to go with less cardamom which otherwise was a little\noverpowering.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nAsia1 month ago\n\n6 apples is way too many to put in this tart. I did end up adding more\nwater, but I’m making this in October and the environmental humidity\ngenuinely may play a role in that. I recommend fresh grinding cardamom\nseeds from cardamom pods.

(2) two lbs of apples is over-generous.\nMany commenters ended up with too many for their pans and mine are piled\nwaaay crazy high. (3) Expected cook time at top of page says 1.5 hrs,\ntext says 40-50, and several commenters had to cook much longer.

Here, a dense, moist cake full of warm fall spices and pumpkin purée is encased in a layer of rich, nutty brown-butter maple glaze. Feel free to make it a day before you plan to serve it: This cake keeps well at room temperature, and you might think it's even better on the second day. Just make sure to keep it covered  and resist the urge to shave off a slice every time you walk by. If you can find it, use organic confectioners' sugar for the glaze. It's made from raw sugar and uses tapioca rather than cornstarch as its anticaking agent. It will give the glaze a richer taste and smoother texture than conventional confectioners’ sugar — a tip picked up from Stella Parks.\",\n  \"author\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Person\",\n    \"name\": \"Yossy Arefi\"\n  },\n  \"image\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/dining/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2-square640.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/dining/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2-square640.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 640,\n      \"width\": 640,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/dining/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2-superJumbo.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/dining/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2-superJumbo.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 1365,\n      \"width\": 2048,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/dining/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2-videoSmall.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/dining/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2-videoSmall.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 281,\n      \"width\": 500,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/dining/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/dining/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg\",\n      \"height\": 1102,\n      \"width\": 735,\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"totalTime\": \"PT2H\",\n  \"recipeYield\": \"10 to 12 servings\",\n  \"recipeCuisine\": \"\",\n  \"recipeCategory\": \"dessert\",\n  \"keywords\": \"allspice, brown butter, bundt cake, cardamom, cinnamon, make-ahead, pumpkin purée, fall, halloween, thanksgiving\",\n  \"aggregateRating\": {\n    \"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n    \"ratingValue\": 5,\n    \"ratingCount\": 2584\n  },\n  \"nutrition\": {\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"NutritionInformation\",\n    \"calories\": 522,\n    \"unsaturatedFatContent\": \"12 grams\",\n    \"carbohydrateContent\": \"78 grams\",\n    \"cholesterolContent\": null,\n    \"fatContent\": \"22 grams\",\n    \"fiberContent\": \"2 grams\",\n    \"proteinContent\": \"5 grams\",\n    \"saturatedFatContent\": \"9 grams\",\n    \"sodiumContent\": \"374 milligrams\",\n    \"sugarContent\": \"49 grams\",\n    \"transFatContent\": \"0 grams\"\n  },\n  \"recipeIngredient\": [\n    \"3 cups/384 grams all-purpose flour\",\n    \"2 teaspoons baking powder\",\n    \"1 teaspoon baking soda\",\n    \"1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt\",\n    \"2 teaspoons ground cinnamon\",\n    \"1 1/2 teaspoons ground cardamom\",\n    \"1/4 teaspoon ground allspice\",\n    \"1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper\",\n    \"2 cups/440 grams light brown sugar, packed\",\n    \"1/2 cup/114 grams unsalted butter, soft but cool\",\n    \"1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil\",\n    \"2 large eggs, at room temperature\",\n    \"1 (15-ounce) can/425 grams pumpkin purée\",\n    \"1/2 cup sour cream\",\n    \"2 tablespoons unsalted butter\",\n    \"1 cup/102 grams confectioners’ sugar (preferably organic), sifted\",\n    \"1/4 cup maple syrup\",\n    \"Pinch of salt\",\n    \"1 to 2 tablespoons lightly toasted pepitas (optional)\"\n  ],\n  \"recipeInstructions\": [\n    {\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"HowToStep\",\n      \"text\": \"Heat oven to 350 degrees, and butter and flour a 12-cup (or larger) capacity bundt pan.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"HowToStep\",\n      \"text\": \"In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, allspice and black pepper until well combined.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"HowToStep\",\n      \"text\": \"In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine brown sugar, butter and olive oil.

Fifteen minutes later my apartment was suddenly filling up with smoke.  I turned off the oven and ran to get my doorman.  He discovered a flaming potholder in with the yams, pulled it out with his bare hands and threw it in the sink.  Meanwhile the cake was still on the cooling rack minding its own business despite the very dense smoke.  I opened every window and went to do laundry because the air was unbreathable.  Two hours later I returned, calmed myself down, and cautiously toasted the pepitas and made the glaze.  After glazing the cake I had to taste test before bringing it in to work to make sure it didn’t taste like ashes.  Delicious! and in a nutshell, indestructible. My doorman will be handsomely rewarded for saving the day.\",\n      \"datePublished\": \"2024-11-25T04:07:30.000Z\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Review\",\n      \"author\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Person\",\n        \"name\": \"Mary\"\n      },\n      \"reviewBody\": \"Can anyone suggest an egg substitute for this cake?

Here, a dense, moist cake full of\nwarm fall spices and pumpkin purée is encased in a layer of rich, nutty\nbrown-butter maple glaze. Feel free to make it a day before you plan to\nserve it: This cake keeps well at room temperature, and you might think\nit's even better on the second day. Just make sure to keep it covered\nand resist the urge to shave off a slice every time you walk by. If you\ncan find it, use organic confectioners' sugar for the glaze. It's made\nfrom raw sugar and uses tapioca rather than cornstarch as its anticaking\nagent. It will give the glaze a richer taste and smoother texture than\nconventional confectioners’ sugar — a tip picked up from Stella Parks.\n\nRead More\n\n-   []Save\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   []Give\n    Subscriber benefit: give recipes to anyone\n\n    As a subscriber, you have 10 gift recipes to give each month.

Step 1\n\n    Heat oven to 350 degrees, and butter and flour a 12-cup (or larger)\n    capacity bundt pan.\n\n2.  Step 2\n\n    In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt,\n    cinnamon, cardamom, allspice and black pepper until well combined.\n\n3.  Step 3\n\n    In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,\n    combine brown sugar, butter and olive oil. Beat on medium-high until\n    light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time,\n    mixing for about 20 seconds in between each egg. Add the pumpkin\n    purée and sour cream, and mix until well combined, scraping the\n    bottom and sides of the bowl as necessary.\n\n4.  Step 4\n\n    Remove the bowl from the mixer, and use a rubber spatula to fold in\n    the dry ingredients until well combined. Make sure to scrape the\n    bottom and sides of the bowl to ensure an evenly mixed batter.\n\n5.  Step 5\n\n    Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smooth the top and firmly tap\n    the pan on the countertop a few times to release any large air\n    bubbles. Bake the cake until golden and puffed, and a tester\n    inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes.\n\n6.  Step 6\n\n    Set the cake, still in its pan, on a rack to cool for 20 minutes,\n    then use the tip of a knife to loosen the edges and invert the cake\n    onto the rack to cool completely before glazing.\n\n7.  Step 7\n\n    Make the glaze: Once the cake is cool, melt the butter in a saucepan\n    over medium heat. Cook the butter, occasionally scraping the bottom\n    and sides of the pan with a rubber spatula until it turns a deep\n    golden brown and smells nutty. Don’t walk away from the pan during\n    this process. The butter can go from brown and nutty to acrid and\n    burnt in mere moments.\n\n8.  Step 8\n\n    Transfer butter and all the brown bits from the pan to a heat-safe\n    bowl, and let it cool slightly. Whisk in the confectioners’ sugar,\n    maple syrup and salt until smooth. The glaze should be thick but\n    pourable. If it’s too thin, add a bit more confectioners’ sugar. If\n    it’s too thick, add a few drops of water.\n\n9.  Step 9\n\n    Transfer the cake to a serving platter and pour the glaze evenly\n    over the top. Sprinkle with pepitas if desired. Let the glaze set\n    for a few minutes before slicing.\n\nSimilar Recipes\n\n[]\n\n-   \n    [All-in-One Holiday Bundt Cake]\n\n    All-in-One Holiday Bundt Cake\n\n    Julia Moskin\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Pecan Sheet Cake ]\n\n    Pumpkin Pecan Sheet Cake \n\n    Sohla El-Waylly\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Maple Cornbread]\n\n    Pumpkin Maple Cornbread\n\n    Samantha Seneviratne\n-   \n    [Apple Bourbon Bundt Cake]\n\n    Apple Bourbon Bundt Cake\n\n    Melissa Clark\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Oatmeal Cookies]\n\n    Pumpkin Oatmeal Cookies\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Vanilla Bundt Cake]\n\n    Vanilla Bundt Cake\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Crumb Cake]\n\n    Pumpkin Crumb Cake\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Lemon Bundt Cake]\n\n    Lemon Bundt Cake\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Lemon Bundt Cake With Poppy Seeds]\n\n    Lemon Bundt Cake With Poppy Seeds\n\n    Martha Rose Shulman\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Layer Cake With Caramel Buttercream]\n\n    Pumpkin Layer Cake With Caramel Buttercream\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Biscuits With Honey Butter]\n\n    Pumpkin Biscuits With Honey Butter\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Maple Muffins]\n\n    Pumpkin Maple Muffins\n\n    Alison Roman\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Bread With Brown Butter and Bourbon]\n\n    Pumpkin Bread With Brown Butter and Bourbon\n\n    Melissa Clark\n-   \n    [Old-Fashioned Doughnut Bundt Cake]\n\n    Old-Fashioned Doughnut Bundt Cake\n\n    Erin Jeanne McDowell\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Sheet Cake With Molasses Cream-Cheese Frosting]\n\n    Pumpkin Sheet Cake With Molasses Cream-Cheese Frosting\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n-   \n    [Spiced Pumpkin Cookie Cake]\n\n    Spiced Pumpkin Cookie Cake\n\n    Jerrelle Guy\n-   \n    [Sour Cream Pound Cake]\n\n    Sour Cream Pound Cake\n\n    Vallery Lomas\n-   \n    [Baked Pumpkin Doughnuts]\n\n    Baked Pumpkin Doughnuts\n\n    Vallery Lomas\n-   \n    [Pumpkin Skillet Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting]\n\n    Pumpkin Skillet Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting\n\n    Erin Jeanne McDowell\n-   \n    [Coffee and Maple Chess Pie]\n\n    Coffee and Maple Chess Pie\n\n    Vaughn Vreeland\n\n[]\n\nRatings\n\n[]\n\n5 out of 5\n\n2,584 user ratings\n\nYour rating\n\n1 star[]2 stars[]3 stars[]4 stars[]5 stars[]\n\nSubmit\n\nLog in or sign up to rate this recipe.\n\nHave you cooked this?\n\n[]Mark as Cooked\n\nLog in or sign up to mark this recipe as cooked.\n\nPrivate Notes\n\nLeave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.\n\nCooking Notes\n\nAdd Note\n\nPublicPrivate\n\nSubmit\n\n-   All Notes\n-   Private\n\nmaustinct7 years ago\n\nThis is a very nice, moist cake - the olive oil recedes and the cardamom\ntakes over in a very pleasant way.

You need to act fast with powdered sugar glazes otherwise they\nharden and make it impossible to get that beautiful drip. Used toasted\nand chopped pecans for finishing. So good!\n\nIs this helpful?[] 13\n\nAuntie Connie5 years ago\n\nI made it exactly as written and agree that it's a beautiful cake. My\nhusband and guests loved it, but I confess to not caring for it very\nmuch. That surprised me because these are flavors I usually love.\nPerhaps boosting the quantity of spices would make me happier, so if I\nmake it again, I'll give that a try. I love the idea of using maple\nsyrup in the frosting, and will probably try that on other cakes I like\nmore.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 12\n\nBill5 years ago\n\nI cooled mine 20 minutes and it came right out. I don't have Nordic Ware\nthough. I well buttered the pan and sprinkled with granulated sugar. The\npan was not warm to the touch after 20 minutes but if anything it came\nout too easily.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 12\n\nLK22 hours ago\n\nReally excellent cake! My five-year-old, who prefers chocolate anything,\nrequests this for breakfast every day. But is a knife to release the\ncake essential? Aren't most Bundts nonstick? I scratched the coating on\nmine; probably should have tried first to release without the knife.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nTenor21 hours ago\n\nAbout halfway through the baking process I discovered that my oven temp\nwas 165 degrees. I turned off the oven, reset the temp, guessed at the\nremaining time, and pulled out the cake when a toothpick came out clean.\nThen put some yams in the oven. Fifteen minutes later my apartment was\nsuddenly filling up with smoke. I turned off the oven and ran to get my\ndoorman. He discovered a flaming potholder in with the yams, pulled it\nout with his bare hands and threw it in the sink. Meanwhile the cake was\nstill on the cooling rack minding its own business despite the very\ndense smoke. I opened every window and went to do laundry because the\nair was unbreathable. Two hours later I returned, calmed myself down,\nand cautiously toasted the pepitas and made the glaze. After glazing the\ncake I had to taste test before bringing it in to work to make sure it\ndidn’t taste like ashes. Delicious! and in a nutshell, indestructible.\nMy doorman will be handsomely rewarded for saving the day.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 1\n\nMary4 days ago\n\nCan anyone suggest an egg substitute for this cake? Several family\nmembers are allergic and I would love it if they could enjoy this cake\ntoo.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nLinda2 weeks ago\n\nI followed the recipe completely with the exception of substituting\nsmall chocolate truffles to adorn the top of the cake instead of the\npepitas, which makes for a lovely presentation. I’ve made it twice and\nboth times almost everyone wanted seconds.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nCindyB2 weeks ago\n\nIf I could give this cake more stars I would. It's the best I've made\nall year. It's easy to make for such a great outcome. I wouldn't change\na thing! Glaze was excellent as well. Make it!!!\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nCindyB2 weeks ago\n\n300g sugar\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nRenee3 weeks ago\n\nCake was delicious but I messed up the glaze\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nLaura3 weeks ago\n\nYossy Arefi never leads me astray. This is a perfect recipe. I followed\nit to a tee, made no alterations, and it turned out most and perfect.\nGreat flavour. My only gripe is I wish that every ingredient was listed\nby weight. If I already have a scale out, it’s annoying to figure out\nthe weight of the maple syrup and olive oil. Will absolutely make this\nagain.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nJen3 weeks ago\n\nAbsolutely delicious and perfect!\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nKitchwitch4 weeks ago\n\nI just took this to a Halloween party with kids and adults attending.\nSubbed more cardamom for the pepper - for kid's taste buds. It was easy\nto make, came together in under 4 hours, and got rave reviews.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nAKM1 month ago\n\nI made this as instructed with excellent results. Looks and tastes\ngreat. The combo of the subtly spiced cake with the maple frosting works\nreally well.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nA1 month ago\n\nDelicious crowd pleaser. The brown-butter maple glaze elevates the cake,\nalthough it is delicious without it too. Great with a glass of milk,\nwhich really brings out the salty-sweet of this tasty treat.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nK1 month ago\n\nCan I adapt this to a differently shaped pan? I don’t have a Bundt pan.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nShirley1 month ago\n\nGreat cake! Doubled the cinnamon, used yogurt rather sour cream. Instead\nof icing, we just use cream cheese on each slab! Delicious\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nAmazing texture, but cardamom-dominant1 month ago\n\nI am not a huge cardamom fan but normally I’m fine with it in baked\ngoods, but this was just too much. If I were to make it again, I’d only\nuse a half or a quarter of what the recipe calls for.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nPrivate notes are only visible to you.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRecipe Tags\n\n-   Allspice\n-   Brown Butter\n-   Bundt Cake\n-   Cardamom\n-   Cinnamon\n-   Make Ahead\n-   Pumpkin Puree\n-   Dessert\n-   Fall\n-   Halloween\n-   Thanksgiving\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLog in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore From Thanksgiving Desserts\n\n[]\n\n-   \n    [Skillet Caramel-Apple Crisp]\n\n    Skillet Caramel-Apple Crisp\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n\n    2296 ratings with an average rating of 5 out of 5 stars[][][][][]\n    2,296\n\n    1 hour\n\n    Save to Recipe Box\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   \n    [Coffee Jelly With Salted Caramel Whipped Cream]\n\n    Coffee Jelly With Salted Caramel Whipped Cream\n\n    Carolina Gelen\n\n    13 ratings with an average rating of 4 out of 5 stars[][][][][]\n    13\n\n    8 ¾ hours\n\n    Save to Recipe Box\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   \n    [Cranberry Pudding]\n\n    Cranberry Pudding\n\n    Carolina Gelen\n\n    15 ratings with an average rating of 4 out of 5 stars[][][][][]\n    15\n\n    5 ¼ hours\n\n    Save to Recipe Box\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   \n    [Sticky Cranberry Gingerbread]\n\n    Sticky Cranberry Gingerbread\n\n    Melissa Clark\n\n    3540 ratings with an average rating of 5 out of 5 stars[][][][][]\n    3,540\n\n    1 1/2 hours plus cooling\n\n    Save to Recipe Box\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   \n    [Rose Apple Tart]\n\n    Rose Apple Tart\n\n    Yossy Arefi\n\n    1577 ratings with an average rating of 5 out of 5 stars[][][][][]\n    1,577\n\n    2 1/2 to 3 hours, plus cooling\n\n    Save to Recipe Box\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   \n    [Tall and Creamy Cheesecake]\n    []\n\n    Tall and Creamy Cheesecake\n\n    Emily Weinstein, Dorie Greenspan\n\n    2843 ratings with an average rating of 5 out of 5 stars[][][][][]\n    2,843\n\n    3 hours 30 minutes, plus at least 4 hours' refrigeration\n\n    Save to Recipe Box\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   Easy\n    [Apple Galette]\n\n    Apple Galette\n\n    Samantha Seneviratne\n\n    255 ratings with an average rating of 5 out of 5 stars[][][][][]\n    255\n\n    2 hours, plus cooling\n\n    Save to Recipe Box\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   \n    [Cranberry Lemon Bars]\n    []\n\n    Cranberry Lemon Bars\n\n    Genevieve Ko\n\n    6098 ratings with an average rating of 4 out of 5 stars[][][][][]\n    6,098\n\n    1 hour, plus cooling and chilling\n\n    Save to Recipe Box\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   \n    [Gâteau Nana]\n\n    Gâteau Nana\n\n    Lisa Donovan, Melissa M.

This is a good base for all sorts of variations to your taste.\",\n      \"datePublished\": \"2019-11-28T06:46:58.000Z\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Review\",\n      \"author\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Person\",\n        \"name\": \"HK\"\n      },\n      \"reviewBody\": \"Might be the tastiest cake I’ve ever made\",\n      \"datePublished\": \"2020-11-25T20:36:08.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExtracted Text:\n[]\n\n-   What to Cook[]\n-   Recipes[]\n-   Ingredients[]\n-   Occasions[]\n-   About[]\n\n[]\n\nWhat to Cook\n\nRecipes\n\nIngredients\n\nOccasions\n\nAbout\n\n-   Staff Picks\n\n    -   Christmas Cookies\n    -   Best Holiday Recipes\n    -   Sheet-Pan Vegetarian Recipes\n    -   Easy Side Dishes\n    -   Holiday Appetizers\n\n-   From Our Newsletters\n\n    -   The Cooking Newsletter\n    -   Five Weeknight Dishes\n    -   The Veggie\n\n-   Perfect For\n\n    -   One-Pot Dinners\n    -   Weeknight Chicken\n    -   Quick Pastas\n    -   30 Minute Vegetarian\n    -   Easy Baking\n\n-   Everyday Recipes\n\n    -   Easy\n    -   Healthy\n    -   Weeknight\n    -   Pasta\n    -   Quick\n\n-   By Meal\n\n    -   Dinner\n    -   Breakfast\n    -   Lunch\n    -   Desserts\n    -   Appetizers\n    -   Side Dishes\n    -   Drinks\n\n-   By Diet\n\n    -   Vegetarian\n    -   Vegan\n    -   Gluten-Free\n    -   Dairy-Free\n\n-   By Method\n\n    -   Air Fryer\n    -   Instant Pot\n    -   Slow Cooker\n    -   BBQ & Grilling\n    -   Sheet Pan\n    -   Baking\n\n-   Meat & Seafood\n\n    -   Chicken\n    -   Beef\n    -   Pork\n    -   Salmon\n    -   Shrimp\n\n-   Vegetables & Fruits\n\n    -   Zucchini\n    -   Sweet Potato\n    -   Eggplant\n    -   Cabbage\n    -   Asparagus\n    -   Tomato\n\n-   Plant-Based Proteins\n\n    -   Tofu\n    -   Lentil\n    -   Chickpea\n    -   Bean\n\n-   Rice, Grains, Pasta\n\n    -   Pasta\n    -   Noodles\n    -   Rice\n    -   Quinoa\n    -   Bread\n    -   Couscous\n\n-   By Upcoming Holiday\n\n    -   Thanksgiving\n    -   Hanukkah\n    -   Noche Buena\n    -   Christmas\n\n-   By Occasion\n\n    -   Birthdays\n    -   Brunch\n    -   Date Night\n    -   Parties\n    -   Picnics\n\n-   -   About Us\n    -   The New York Times Food Section\n\n[]\n\n[]\n\n[]\n\n[]\n\n[]\n\nWhat to Cook\n\nStaff Picks\n\n-   Christmas Cookies\n-   Best Holiday Recipes\n-   Sheet-Pan Vegetarian Recipes\n-   Easy Side Dishes\n-   Holiday Appetizers\n\nFrom Our Newsletters\n\n-   The Cooking Newsletter\n-   Five Weeknight Dishes\n-   The Veggie\n\nPerfect For\n\n-   One-Pot Dinners\n-   Weeknight Chicken\n-   Quick Pastas\n-   30 Minute Vegetarian\n-   Easy Baking\n\nRecipes\n\nEveryday Recipes\n\n-   Easy\n-   Healthy\n-   Weeknight\n-   Pasta\n-   Quick\n\nBy Meal\n\n-   Dinner\n-   Breakfast\n-   Lunch\n-   Desserts\n-   Appetizers\n-   Side Dishes\n-   Drinks\n\nBy Diet\n\n-   Vegetarian\n-   Vegan\n-   Gluten-Free\n-   Dairy-Free\n\nBy Method\n\n-   Air Fryer\n-   Instant Pot\n-   Slow Cooker\n-   BBQ & Grilling\n-   Sheet Pan\n-   Baking\n\nIngredients\n\nMeat & Seafood\n\n-   Chicken\n-   Beef\n-   Pork\n-   Salmon\n-   Shrimp\n\nVegetables & Fruits\n\n-   Zucchini\n-   Sweet Potato\n-   Eggplant\n-   Cabbage\n-   Asparagus\n-   Tomato\n\nPlant-Based Proteins\n\n-   Tofu\n-   Lentil\n-   Chickpea\n-   Bean\n\nRice, Grains, Pasta\n\n-   Pasta\n-   Noodles\n-   Rice\n-   Quinoa\n-   Bread\n-   Couscous\n\nOccasions\n\nBy Upcoming Holiday\n\n-   Thanksgiving\n-   Hanukkah\n-   Noche Buena\n-   Christmas\n\nBy Occasion\n\n-   Birthdays\n-   Brunch\n-   Date Night\n-   Parties\n-   Picnics\n\nAbout\n\n-   About Us\n-   The New York Times Food Section\n\nCranberry Sauce\n\nBy Sam Sifton\n\nUpdated Nov. 4, 2024\n\n[Cranberry Sauce]\n\nJim Wilson/The New York Times\n\nTotal Time\n    10 minutes, plus chilling\n\nRating\n    4[][][][][](3,232)\n\nNotes\n    Read community notes[]\n\nCranberry sauce should be sweet but not cloying, and tart without\ncausing pucker and anguish. It should have a jelly-like quality, but\nshould owe more to the appearance of jam. The key element to making\ncranberry sauce is to understand that cranberries are high in pectin, a\ncarbohydrate that exists in many fruits and which is released by the\nberries when they are heated and the cells of the fruit break down. In\nthe presence of sugar, the pectin molecules bond to one another, forming\na kind of gel. The longer you cook a cranberry sauce, the more pectin is\nreleased and liquid is evaporated, and the stiffer the result will be.\nScience! Sometimes it's helpful. So is spice. Some like a clove or two\nadded to their cranberry sauce. (I am not one of them.) Others, a\nwhisper of ginger and a small handful of nuts, for texture. Of this, I\napprove.

I usually end up adding another 1/3 cup\nof sugar - it really depends on your cranberries. I find that adding the\norange juice after it's really thick tastes better - cooked orange juice\ncan be bitter. I add the fresh zest at the same time. Delicious!\n\nIs this helpful?[] 285\n\nMarguerite6 years ago\n\nA tipple of Grand Marnier as it cools is a nice touch.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 167\n\nbetteirene6 years ago\n\nThis sauce is so good on sandwiches made with leftover turkey: Sturdy\nwhite or wheat bread, mayo, swiss, turkey, sauce, lettuce (or not). I\nkeep a bag or two of cranberries in the basement freezer just to make\nthis sauce for sandwiches during non-holiday times of the year. I like\nit on ham sandwiches, too.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 76\n\nKatherine6 years ago\n\nFor us, this was just too sweet and too orange-y, even with only 1/2 cup\nsugar. Next time we'll go back to the tried-and-true orange zest plus\nwater, not juice.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 51\n\nPatty H.6 years ago\n\nI follow the recipe on the bag of fresh cranberries adding water and\norange in equal amounts. I add a generous amount of orange zest and a\npiece of fresh peeled ginger root cut into slices which I remove after\nthe cranberry sauce has chilled. That definitely kicks it up a notch.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 46\n\nhavaiisteve4 years ago\n\nI usually make another dish that requires I strain the juice from a can\nof pineapple bits. I use the pineapple juice in place of the orange\njuice. The dish is very popular with our friends and is requested for\nT'day pot luck dinners\n\nIs this helpful?[] 30\n\nAnne NYC4 years ago\n\nI did not have Grand Marnier but added a tipple of Cointreau, which is\nalso an orange liqueuer. Grated ginger and orange rind. And this keeps\nfor months in a glass jar in the fridge. Great on toasted english\nmuffins!\n\nIs this helpful?[] 25\n\nrrp6 years ago\n\nAgree with other commenters - just too sweet. I fixed with a squirt of\nlemon juice.

I add sugar as I go I don’t like it too\nsweet. Depending on my mood I’ll add either vanilla or grand marnier but\nlately it’s been vanilla then add the zest. After Canadian then American\nthanksgiving and xmas I am all in for cranberry sauce on toast because\nreally it’s the best ever jam!\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nJoe1 week ago\n\nThe sweeter the better. One cup of sugar, zest an orange, juice the\norange, throw the whole thing in the pot while the berries are cooking.\nDon't forget the cinnamon stick. Delicious. I then refrigerate, if\nthere's anything left over, leaving the orange rind and cinnamon stick\nin with the cranberry sauce...heightens the flavor.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nJanet A1 week ago\n\nI add garam masala to the cranberry sauce in the last minute or two of\ncooking.

How do I make cranberry sauce?[]\n\n    To make cranberry sauce, you need three ingredients: cranberries,\n    sugar and cooking liquid. Combine fresh or frozen cranberries with\n    sugar and liquid, such as orange juice or water, in a saucepan over\n    medium-high. Cook until the sugar dissolves and cranberries burst.\n    Stir, adding seasonings like orange or lemon zest, or spices if you\n    like, then cook a few more minutes, until saucy. Let the cranberry\n    sauce cool, then transfer to a serving dish, cover and chill in the\n    refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving.\n\n2.  Can you freeze cranberry sauce? []\n\n    Any cranberry sauce made without gelatin can be stored in an\n    airtight container in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw in the\n    refrigerator overnight before serving. Cranberry molds, or any other\n    sauce that is set with gelatin, cannot be frozen.\n\n3.  What should I do with leftover cranberry sauce?[]\n\n    Leftover cranberry sauce can be used like a jam or jelly to spread\n    on sandwiches. You can also make a salsa with it, combine it with\n    whipped cream and yogurt for an easy treat or dessert topping,\n    slather it on pancakes or waffles or even bake it into a hot\n    pocket. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCredits\n\nThanksgiving: How to Cook It Well by Sam Sifton\n\nRecipe Tags\n\n-   American\n-   Condiments\n-
