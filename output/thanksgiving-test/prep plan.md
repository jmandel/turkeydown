# Prep Plan

Here's a prep schedule table organized by day and dish:

| Day | Wild Rice Soup | Broccoli Rabe | Turkey | Stuffing |
|-----|----------------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Sunday Night | - | - | - Remove turkey from freezer to begin thawing in refrigerator (if frozen) | - |
| Monday | - Chop mushrooms, onions, celery, carrots and store in separate containers | - | - Continue thawing | - |
| Tuesday | - Mince garlic and store | - Trim and wash broccoli rabe, store wrapped in paper towels | - Continue thawing | - Cut bread into cubes, leave out to dry<br>- Chop herbs and store |
| Wednesday | - Make entire soup<br>- Store in refrigerator (flavors improve overnight)<br>- Don't add sour cream or garnishes | - Slice garlic and store | - Make herb-butter mixture<br>- Spatchcock turkey<br>- Dry brine in fridge overnight | - Dice celery and onions<br>- Store prepped ingredients separately |
| Thursday | - Gently reheat soup<br>- Add sour cream<br>- Add fresh garnishes | - Blanch and sauté just before serving | - Remove from fridge 1-2 hours before cooking<br>- Roast turkey<br>- Rest 30 mins before carving | - Sauté vegetables<br>- Assemble and bake stuffing while turkey rests |

This schedule:
1. Starts turkey thawing early
2. Frontloads prep work
3. Makes soup ahead since it improves with time
4. Keeps broccoli rabe fresh by cooking last-minute
5. Allows stuffing to be fresh-baked
6. Coordinates timing of final dishes
