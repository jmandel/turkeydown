Here's a prep schedule table for the two dishes, keeping Sunday focused on turkey prep and optimizing for both freshness and efficient time management:

| Day | Wild Rice Soup | Broccoli Rabe |
|-----|----------------|---------------|
| Sunday Night | No prep (turkey day) | No prep (turkey day) |
| Monday | - Chop mushrooms, onions, celery, carrots, and garlic<br>- Store prepped vegetables separately in airtight containers | None |
| Tuesday | - Make full soup through step 4<br>- Cool and store (don't add sour cream yet) | None |
| Wednesday | None | - Trim broccoli rabe<br>- Slice garlic<br>- Store prepped ingredients separately |
| Thursday AM | - Reheat soup gently<br>- Complete steps 6-7 with sour cream and garnishes | - Blanch broccoli rabe<br>- Complete final saut√© just before serving |

This schedule:
- Allows the soup flavors to develop over time
- Keeps the broccoli rabe fresh and crisp
- Consolidates chopping tasks on Monday
- Avoids overwhelming Thursday with too many tasks
- Preserves the best texture for both dishes
