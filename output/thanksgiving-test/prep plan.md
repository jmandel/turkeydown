Here's a prep schedule table for the two dishes, keeping in mind the notes about Sunday and baked goods:

| Day | Wild Rice Soup | Broccoli Rabe |
|-----|----------------|---------------|
| Sunday | Skip - focus on turkey | Skip - focus on turkey |
| Monday | - Chop mushrooms<br>- Dice onions, carrots, celery<br>- Smash/chop garlic | No prep needed |
| Tuesday | No prep needed | - Trim broccoli rabe<br>- Slice garlic |
| Wednesday | - Make complete soup<br>- Store in fridge (don't add sour cream yet) | No prep needed |
| Thursday | - Reheat soup gently<br>- Add sour cream when warm<br>- Chop fresh herbs for garnish | - Blanch and shock broccoli rabe<br>- Final saut√© with garlic<br>- Season and serve hot |

Key Strategy Notes:
- The soup benefits from being made ahead as flavors develop overnight
- Broccoli rabe is best prepared fresh day-of for optimal texture and color
- Wednesday prep of the soup allows for easy reheating on Thursday
- Chopping/prep work is spread across Monday and Tuesday to avoid overwhelm
- All fresh herb garnishes are left for Thursday
