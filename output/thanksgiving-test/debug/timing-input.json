      "{\"minutes\": 35}\n\nI arrived at this estimate by adding up the active preparation and cooking steps:\n- Chopping vegetables and measuring ingredients: ~10 minutes\n- Cooking onions: 5 minutes\n- Cooking mushrooms: 8 minutes\n- Adding other ingredients and stirring: ~3 minutes\n- Final steps (whisking sour cream, seasoning, garnishing): ~4 minutes\n- Miscellaneous active time (checking rice, adjusting seasonings): ~5 minutes\n\nNote: This doesn't include passive cooking time (pressure cooking and natural release time) or optional reduction time, as these don't require active attention.\n",
