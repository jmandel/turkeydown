        "# Pressure Cooker Mushroom and Wild Rice Soup\n\n## Ingredients\n- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter\n- 1 yellow or red onion, minced\n- 2 pounds mixed mushrooms (cremini and shiitake), chopped into 1/2-1 inch pieces\n- Kosher salt and black pepper\n- 2 celery stalks, chopped\n- 1 large carrot, peeled and chopped\n- 6 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped\n- 3 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme\n- 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n- 5 cups vegetable or chicken stock\n- 1/2 cup dry white wine\n- 1 cup wild rice (about 6 ounces)\n- 1/2 cup sour cream\n- Chopped scallions or chives and fresh dill, for topping\n\n## Steps\n1. Turn on sauté setting on 6-8 quart pressure cooker. Melt butter and add onion. Cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.\n\n2. Add mushrooms and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook until mushrooms release liquid and shrink, about 8 minutes. Add celery, carrot, garlic, thyme, garlic powder and black pepper. Stir in flour until vegetables are evenly coated.\n\n3. Pour in stock and wine, turn off heat. Scrape bottom of pot thoroughly. Stir in wild rice.\n\n4. Cook on high pressure for 10-12 minutes. Let pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then release remaining pressure manually.\n\n5. Check rice texture; if needed, pressure cook 2 more minutes and quickly release pressure. For thicker soup, use sauté function to reduce to desired consistency.\n\n6. Whisk sour cream with a few spoonfuls of warm soup in a small bowl, then stir mixture into soup. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n7. Serve topped with scallions/chives and dill. Reheat leftovers on low to prevent sour cream from breaking.\n\nNote: To substitute wine, use 1/4 cup additional stock/water plus 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar or lemon juice.\n",
        "# Broccoli Rabe\n\n## Ingredients\n- 1 bunch broccoli rabe\n- 3-4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced\n- 3 tablespoons olive oil\n- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes\n- Salt to taste\n- Black pepper to taste\n\n## Steps\n1. Trim about 1 inch off the stems of the broccoli rabe and discard any yellowed leaves. Wash thoroughly and shake off excess water.\n\n2. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add broccoli rabe and blanch for 1-2 minutes until bright green and slightly tender.\n\n3. Drain immediately and place in ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain again and pat dry.\n\n4. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sliced garlic and red pepper flakes, cooking until garlic is light golden, about 1-2 minutes.\n\n5. Add the blanched broccoli rabe to the skillet. Season with salt and black pepper.\n\n6. Sauté for 3-4 minutes, tossing occasionally, until the broccoli rabe is tender but still has some bite.\n\n7. Serve hot as a side dish, drizzling with additional olive oil if desired.\n"

Food Stylist: Simon Andrews.\n\nTotal Time\n    About 1 hour\n\nRating\n    5[][][][][](3,122)\n\nNotes\n    Read community notes[]\n\nThis comforting soup tastes long-simmered, but it’s cooked in a pressure\ncooker, which makes it a weeknight possibility (though you could also\nmake this recipe in a slow cooker). Use any variety of mushrooms you\nlike: Cremini (also called baby bella) are affordable and easy to find\nand work well, or you can add shiitake or oyster mushrooms for a mix of\ntexture and flavors. Don’t worry about removing small, supple stems, but\ndiscard any that are tough or dried-out. Wild rice isn’t a true rice at\nall but the seed of a grass that’s native to North America. When it’s\ncooked, it should be pleasantly chewy and nutty, not hard, and most of\nthe grains should be slightly split open to reveal their creamy insides.\n\nRead More\n\n-   []Save\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   []Give\n    Subscriber benefit: give recipes to anyone\n\n    As a subscriber, you have 10 gift recipes to give each month.

Step 1\n\n    Turn on the sauté setting on a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure\n    cooker. Melt the butter, then add the onion. Cook, stirring\n    occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes.\n\n2.  Step 2\n\n    Add the mushrooms and 1 teaspoon salt, and cook, stirring\n    occasionally, until the mushrooms have released their liquid and\n    shrunk a bit, about 8 minutes. Add the celery, carrot, chopped\n    garlic, thyme, garlic powder and several generous grinds of black\n    pepper. Stir to combine. Add the flour and stir until the vegetables\n    are evenly coated and no white spots remain.\n\n3.  Step 3\n\n    Pour in the stock and wine, and turn off the heat. Scrape the bottom\n    of the pot very well to incorporate flour and any browned bits that\n    are stuck to the bottom. (This will add flavor and also prevent a\n    burn warning later.) Stir in the wild rice.\n\n4.  Step 4\n\n    Cook on high pressure for 10 to 12 minutes. Turn off the heat and\n    let the pressure reduce naturally for 10 minutes, then release the\n    remaining pressure manually.\n\n5.  Step 5\n\n    Stir the soup and check the texture of the wild rice; if it needs a\n    bit more time repeat the pressure cooking process for a cook time of\n    2 minutes and rapidly release the pressure. Check the texture of the\n    soup; if you’d like it to be thicker, turn on the sauté function and\n    let the soup simmer to reduce to desired consistency. Turn off the\n    heat.\n\n6.  Step 6\n\n    Put the sour cream in a small bowl and slowly whisk in a few\n    spoonfuls of warm soup until smooth, then stir the mixture into the\n    soup. (This prevents the sour cream from separating.) Taste the soup\n    and add salt and pepper to taste.\n\n7.  Step 7\n\n    Serve the soup in bowls topped with chopped scallions or chives and\n    dill. Reheat any leftovers on low until warm. (Boiling can cause the\n    sour cream to break.)\n\nTip\n\n-   If you prefer to cook without wine, instead add ¼ cup more water or\n    stock and 2 teaspoons of white wine vinegar or lemon juice.\n\nSimilar Recipes\n\n[]\n\n-   \n    [Slow Cooker Mushroom and Wild Rice Soup]\n\n    Slow Cooker Mushroom and Wild Rice Soup\n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n-   \n    [Slow-Cooker Beef and Barley Soup]\n\n    Slow-Cooker Beef and Barley Soup\n\n    Ali Slagle\n-   \n    [One-Pot Mushroom and Ginger Rice]\n\n    One-Pot Mushroom and Ginger Rice\n\n    Hetty Lui McKinnon\n-   \n    [Wild Rice and Mushroom Casserole]\n\n    Wild Rice and Mushroom Casserole\n\n    Melissa Clark\n-   \n    [Mushroom Risotto With Peas]\n\n    Mushroom Risotto With Peas\n\n    Martha Rose Shulman\n-   \n    [Wild Rice and Mushroom Soup]\n\n    Wild Rice and Mushroom Soup\n\n    Martha Rose Shulman\n-   \n    [Mushroom Barley Soup]\n\n    Mushroom Barley Soup\n\n    Dawn Lerman\n-   \n    [Pressure Cooker Chicken Soup With Lemon and Rice]\n\n    Pressure Cooker Chicken Soup With Lemon and Rice\n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n-   \n    [Mushroom-Barley Soup]\n\n    Mushroom-Barley Soup\n\n    Mark Bittman\n-   \n    [Miso-Mushroom Barley Soup]\n\n    Miso-Mushroom Barley Soup\n\n    Yasmin Fahr\n-   \n    [Wild Rice Dressing With Mushrooms and Chile Crisp]\n\n    Wild Rice Dressing With Mushrooms and Chile Crisp\n\n    Nik Sharma\n-   \n    [Fresh and Wild Mushroom Stew]\n\n    Fresh and Wild Mushroom Stew\n\n    David Tanis\n-   \n    [Pressure Cooker Porcini Risotto]\n\n    Pressure Cooker Porcini Risotto\n\n    Mark Bittman\n-   \n    [Mushroom Soup]\n\n    Mushroom Soup\n\n    Mark Bittman\n-   \n    [Wild Rice With Mushrooms]\n\n    Wild Rice With Mushrooms\n\n    Ligaya Mishan\n-   \n    [Slow-Cooker Cauliflower, Potato and White Bean Soup]\n\n    Slow-Cooker Cauliflower, Potato and White Bean Soup\n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n-   \n    [Instant Pot Mushroom and Potato Paprikash ]\n\n    Instant Pot Mushroom and Potato Paprikash \n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n-   \n    [Wild Mushroom Soup]\n\n    Wild Mushroom Soup\n\n    Jeff Gordinier\n-   \n    [Pressure Cooker Lentil Soup With Sausage]\n\n    Pressure Cooker Lentil Soup With Sausage\n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n-   \n    [Pressure Cooker White Bean-Parmesan Soup]\n\n    Pressure Cooker White Bean-Parmesan Soup\n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n\n[]\n\nRatings\n\n[]\n\n5 out of 5\n\n3,122 user ratings\n\nYour rating\n\n1 star[]2 stars[]3 stars[]4 stars[]5 stars[]\n\nSubmit\n\nLog in or sign up to rate this recipe.\n\nHave you cooked this?\n\n[]Mark as Cooked\n\nLog in or sign up to mark this recipe as cooked.\n\nPrivate Notes\n\nLeave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.\n\nCooking Notes\n\nAdd Note\n\nPublicPrivate\n\nSubmit\n\n-   All Notes\n-   Private\n\nHope3 years ago\n\nTo make without pressure or slow cooker: Once you've stirred in the wild\nrice at the end of step 3, simmer the soup covered until the rice is\ncooked.

Will parboil it next time before adding.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nJK3 weeks ago\n\nI make without the sour cream, we prefer the broth base. Parsley instead\nof dill and a nice crusty baguette with some French butter on the side.\nPerfect!\n\nIs this helpful?[] 1\n\nCecilia1 month ago\n\nI cut butter in half, used black lentils instead of rice for added\nprotein and upped the broth. Next time I’d chop the mushrooms a bit\nsmaller.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nLB1 month ago\n\nI added a few teaspoons of miso paste to this recipe at the end and I\nomitted adding the sour cream to the entire dish. Instead, I put a\ndollop of sour cream in each serving and mixed it. This way I can freeze\nportions without it getting weird.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 1\n\nDill Weed4 months ago\n\nI used dill weed instead of thyme. Tasty!\n\nIs this helpful?[] 1\n\nC5 months ago\n\nDelicious soup recipe! Changes I made: used half the butter and added\nolive oil. Added rehydrated mushroom mix for some extra umami. Followed\nthe wine substitution method but instead of using broth, added the water\nused to soak dehydrated mushrooms. Topped the soup with truffle oil.\nChanges for next time: more rice to add bulk (possibly 1.5 cups)\nDefinitely not a quick weeknight dinner recipe. 1 hour cook time is\naccurate. But good for meal prep and I think has excellent ROI.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 1\n\nMary6 months ago\n\nI just cooked this soup and it’s delicious. I prepared the soup on my\nstove top. Cooked the brown rice/wild rice combination in a separate pot\nwith chicken stock. Cooked all the other ingredients in my large stock\npot separately. I did add butter that was already mixed with white miso\nfrom my refrigerator.. I would serve this with crispy toasted baguettes\nI just cookedand a Caesar salad on the side. I couldn’t be more pleased\nwith this dish. I’m sure that it freezes well. this soup is a winner\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nFaye7 months ago\n\nRice no where near cooked at 12 mins. Put in for another 8 mins. Still\nquite chewy - I know it's supposed to be somewhat, but I probably would\nadd more stock and pressure cook for 20 mins in future. Perhaps I'm less\nadept at chopping, but I wouldn't consider this a week night dish.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nKate8 months ago\n\nThis made a delicious soup! Not the biggest garlic fan for soups, so I\nreduced to 4 garlic cloves and scratched the garlic powder. Added 2 bay\nleaves. The 6 qt instant pot is not big enough to accommodate all the\nmushrooms that this recipe calls for. It can fit 1.5 lbs of mushrooms, 2\nlbs was a bit too ambitious.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nDrake Baer9 months ago\n\nManzanilla instead of red wine. Triple the thyme. Additional butter at\nthe end instead of sour cream. I found the sour cream muddled the\nexquisite taste of the shrooms, butter and sherry. As written, this\ndoesn’t quite work as vegetarian stroganoff.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nErika9 months ago\n\nSo good! Leftovers were excellent too. Easily cooked on the stove-top in\na Dutch oven with slight modification. I added 2 stalks of leeks, as\nthey seemed fitting. I put the firmer vegetables in after the onion to\ncook down and sweat, then put all of the mushrooms in until they shrunk\ntoo. I added the broth, wild rice, etc as directed and let it simmer for\n~45min. Then sour cream, etc. The textures were all perfect that way.\nJust test the rice here and there to taste when it's done. Enjoy!\n\nIs this helpful?[] 1\n\nPrivate notes are only visible to you.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRecipe Tags\n\n-   American\n-   Dry White
