# Thanksgiving 2024



## Recipes
### Pressure Cooker Mushroom and Wild Rice Soup

#### Ingredients
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 yellow or red onion, minced
- 2 pounds mixed mushrooms (cremini and shiitake), chopped into ½- to 1-inch pieces
- 2 celery stalks, chopped
- 1 large carrot, peeled and chopped
- 6 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 5 cups vegetable or chicken stock
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 1 cup wild rice (about 6 ounces)
- ½ cup sour cream
- Chopped scallions or chives and fresh dill, for topping
- Kosher salt and black pepper to taste

#### Steps
1. Using the sauté setting on a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure cooker, melt butter and cook minced onion until translucent, about 5 minutes.

2. Add mushrooms and 1 teaspoon salt, cook until mushrooms release liquid and shrink, about 8 minutes. Add celery, carrot, garlic, thyme, garlic powder and black pepper. Stir in flour until vegetables are evenly coated.

3. Pour in stock and wine, turn off heat. Scrape pot bottom thoroughly to incorporate flour and browned bits. Stir in wild rice.

4. Cook on high pressure for 10-12 minutes. Let pressure reduce naturally for 10 minutes, then release remaining pressure manually.

5. Check rice texture; if needed, pressure cook additional 2 minutes with quick release. For thicker soup, use sauté function to reduce to desired consistency.

6. Whisk sour cream with a few spoonfuls of warm soup in a small bowl, then stir mixture into soup. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

7. Serve topped with chopped scallions/chives and dill. Reheat leftovers gently on low heat to prevent sour cream from separating.

### Sautéed Broccoli Rabe

#### Ingredients
- 1 bunch broccoli rabe (rapini), trimmed
- 3-4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 2-3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/4-1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- Salt to taste
- Black pepper to taste
- Lemon juice (optional)
- Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling (optional)

#### Steps
1. Trim the tough ends from broccoli rabe and wash thoroughly.

2. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Blanch broccoli rabe for 1-2 minutes, then drain. For best color, shock in ice water (optional), then drain well.

3. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sliced garlic and red pepper flakes, sautéing until garlic is lightly golden, about 1-2 minutes.

4. Add blanched broccoli rabe to the pan and season with salt and black pepper. Sauté for 3-5 minutes until tender-crisp.

5. Remove from heat and transfer to serving dish. If desired, finish with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice or a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.

6. Serve hot.

### Spatchcocked Turkey with Herbed Stuffing

#### Turkey Ingredients
- 1 whole turkey (12-14 lbs)
- 4 tablespoons softened butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

6. Season generously with salt and pepper all over
7. Roast at 425°F for approximately 90 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 165°F at thickest part

#### Stuffing Ingredients
- 1 loaf day-old bread, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2 cups celery, diced
- 2 cups onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup butter
- 2-3 cups chicken broth

Use any variety of mushrooms you\nlike: Cremini (also called baby bella) are affordable and easy to find\nand work well, or you can add shiitake or oyster mushrooms for a mix of\ntexture and flavors. Don’t worry about removing small, supple stems, but\ndiscard any that are tough or dried-out. Wild rice isn’t a true rice at\nall but the seed of a grass that’s native to North America. When it’s\ncooked, it should be pleasantly chewy and nutty, not hard, and most of\nthe grains should be slightly split open to reveal their creamy insides.\n\nRead More\n\n-   []Save\n    Log in or sign up to save this recipe.\n\n-   []Give\n    Subscriber benefit: give recipes to anyone\n\n    As a subscriber, you have 10 gift recipes to give each month.

Step 1\n\n    Turn on the sauté setting on a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure\n    cooker. Melt the butter, then add the onion. Cook, stirring\n    occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes.\n\n2.  Step 2\n\n    Add the mushrooms and 1 teaspoon salt, and cook, stirring\n    occasionally, until the mushrooms have released their liquid and\n    shrunk a bit, about 8 minutes. Add the celery, carrot, chopped\n    garlic, thyme, garlic powder and several generous grinds of black\n    pepper. Stir to combine. Add the flour and stir until the vegetables\n    are evenly coated and no white spots remain.\n\n3.  Step 3\n\n    Pour in the stock and wine, and turn off the heat. Scrape the bottom\n    of the pot very well to incorporate flour and any browned bits that\n    are stuck to the bottom. (This will add flavor and also prevent a\n    burn warning later.) Stir in the wild rice.\n\n4.  Step 4\n\n    Cook on high pressure for 10 to 12 minutes. Turn off the heat and\n    let the pressure reduce naturally for 10 minutes, then release the\n    remaining pressure manually.\n\n5.  Step 5\n\n    Stir the soup and check the texture of the wild rice; if it needs a\n    bit more time repeat the pressure cooking process for a cook time of\n    2 minutes and rapidly release the pressure. Check the texture of the\n    soup; if you’d like it to be thicker, turn on the sauté function and\n    let the soup simmer to reduce to desired consistency. Turn off the\n    heat.\n\n6.  Step 6\n\n    Put the sour cream in a small bowl and slowly whisk in a few\n    spoonfuls of warm soup until smooth, then stir the mixture into the\n    soup. (This prevents the sour cream from separating.) Taste the soup\n    and add salt and pepper to taste.\n\n7.  Step 7\n\n    Serve the soup in bowls topped with chopped scallions or chives and\n    dill. Reheat any leftovers on low until warm. (Boiling can cause the\n    sour cream to break.)\n\nTip\n\n-   If you prefer to cook without wine, instead add ¼ cup more water or\n    stock and 2 teaspoons of white wine vinegar or lemon juice.\n\nSimilar Recipes\n\n[]\n\n-   \n    [Slow Cooker Mushroom and Wild Rice Soup]\n\n    Slow Cooker Mushroom and Wild Rice Soup\n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n-   \n    [Slow-Cooker Beef and Barley Soup]\n\n    Slow-Cooker Beef and Barley Soup\n\n    Ali Slagle\n-   \n    [One-Pot Mushroom and Ginger Rice]\n\n    One-Pot Mushroom and Ginger Rice\n\n    Hetty Lui McKinnon\n-   \n    [Wild Rice and Mushroom Casserole]\n\n    Wild Rice and Mushroom Casserole\n\n    Melissa Clark\n-   \n    [Mushroom Risotto With Peas]\n\n    Mushroom Risotto With Peas\n\n    Martha Rose Shulman\n-   \n    [Wild Rice and Mushroom Soup]\n\n    Wild Rice and Mushroom Soup\n\n    Martha Rose Shulman\n-   \n    [Mushroom Barley Soup]\n\n    Mushroom Barley Soup\n\n    Dawn Lerman\n-   \n    [Pressure Cooker Chicken Soup With Lemon and Rice]\n\n    Pressure Cooker Chicken Soup With Lemon and Rice\n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n-   \n    [Mushroom-Barley Soup]\n\n    Mushroom-Barley Soup\n\n    Mark Bittman\n-   \n    [Miso-Mushroom Barley Soup]\n\n    Miso-Mushroom Barley Soup\n\n    Yasmin Fahr\n-   \n    [Wild Rice Dressing With Mushrooms and Chile Crisp]\n\n    Wild Rice Dressing With Mushrooms and Chile Crisp\n\n    Nik Sharma\n-   \n    [Fresh and Wild Mushroom Stew]\n\n    Fresh and Wild Mushroom Stew\n\n    David Tanis\n-   \n    [Pressure Cooker Porcini Risotto]\n\n    Pressure Cooker Porcini Risotto\n\n    Mark Bittman\n-   \n    [Mushroom Soup]\n\n    Mushroom Soup\n\n    Mark Bittman\n-   \n    [Wild Rice With Mushrooms]\n\n    Wild Rice With Mushrooms\n\n    Ligaya Mishan\n-   \n    [Slow-Cooker Cauliflower, Potato and White Bean Soup]\n\n    Slow-Cooker Cauliflower, Potato and White Bean Soup\n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n-   \n    [Instant Pot Mushroom and Potato Paprikash ]\n\n    Instant Pot Mushroom and Potato Paprikash \n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n-   \n    [Wild Mushroom Soup]\n\n    Wild Mushroom Soup\n\n    Jeff Gordinier\n-   \n    [Pressure Cooker Lentil Soup With Sausage]\n\n    Pressure Cooker Lentil Soup With Sausage\n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n-   \n    [Pressure Cooker White Bean-Parmesan Soup]\n\n    Pressure Cooker White Bean-Parmesan Soup\n\n    Sarah DiGregorio\n\n[]\n\nRatings\n\n[]\n\n5 out of 5\n\n3,122 user ratings\n\nYour rating\n\n1 star[]2 stars[]3 stars[]4 stars[]5 stars[]\n\nSubmit\n\nLog in or sign up to rate this recipe.\n\nHave you cooked this?\n\n[]Mark as Cooked\n\nLog in or sign up to mark this recipe as cooked.\n\nPrivate Notes\n\nLeave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.\n\nCooking Notes\n\nAdd Note\n\nPublicPrivate\n\nSubmit\n\n-   All Notes\n-   Private\n\nHope3 years ago\n\nTo make without pressure or slow cooker: Once you've stirred in the wild\nrice at the end of step 3, simmer the soup covered until the rice is\ncooked. The time will vary depending on your rice (and how old it is),\nbut figure about 40-45 minutes.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 369\n\ncindi3 years ago\n\nI don’t have a pressure cooker, if I am just using a large Dutch oven on\nthe stove top how long do I cook the rice\n\nIs this helpful?[] 144\n\nMia3 years ago\n\nFor a slow cooker, sauté as directed in a saucepan. Add sautéed veggies\nto slow cooker with rest of ingredients (except cream and garnish). Cook\non low for 8 hours of on high for 6 hours. Check in to ensure sufficient\nliquid occasionally. When wild rice cracks open so you can see the\nlighter color inside, it’s ready. Mix in the cream and add garnish per\nthe recipe.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 87\n\nMitchell3 years ago\n\nLesson learned: Black rice makes soups purple. :)\n\nIs this helpful?[] 80\n\nStephanie3 years ago\n\nVery VERY tasty soup! We are eating low fat plant based diet, so I left\noff the butter (using a spritz of olive oil cooking spray instead) and\nsubstituted soy milk for the sour cream. The wild rice we had on hand\nwas Lundberg's wild rice blend and that cooked up perfectly with 10\nminutes cook time in our Instapot. Turned out rich and delicious!\n\nIs this helpful?[] 71\n\nSuzanne3 years ago\n\nI've made a stove top version of this for years. Since wild rice,\ndepending upon age and source, can often be hard and chewy, I routinely\nsoak it all day or even overnight.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 56\n\nLaura3 years ago\n\nAny ideas how to cook this stovetop in a soup pot?\n\nIs this helpful?[] 55\n\nelizaBeth Simpson3 years ago\n\nto questions about doing stovetop: you can also cook the wild rice\nseparately in the broth (either in a rice cooker or on the stove) and\nadd it at step 3, then just simmer a few minutes to incorporate. (I\nthink this is a plus to not overcook the flavor out of the\nveggies/spices while the rice is cooking).\n\nIs this helpful?[] 52\n\nMmm3 years ago\n\nSuggestions for a vegan replacement to sour cream?\n\nIs this helpful?[] 33\n\nSarah H3 years ago\n\nI have neither a slow cooker nor a pressure cooker.

Cleaning and chopping 2 lbs of mushrooms was exactly the\nmindful, meditative task I needed after a stressful Friday at work. And\nthe delicious, aromatic bowl of nirvana at the end .... who doesn't need\nthat now??\n\nIs this helpful?[] 22\n\ntworose3 years ago\n\nI made this soup in a 5 qt le creuset dutch oven on the top of the\nstove, and after stirring in the rice, I put it covered in a 300 degree\noven for 2 hours. (Check every 30 minutes to be sure there's still\nenough liquid - I didn't have to add any.) The rice came out perfect,\nand the house smelled delicious all afternoon. I used half shitaki and\nhalf crimini mushrooms, rice flour (GF), vegetable stock, 1/4 cup lemon\njuice instead of wine, and soy milk instead of sour cream. Came out\ngreat!\n\nIs this helpful?[] 21\n\nMomof4inFL6 days ago\n\nNot sure what went wrong here. I followed the directions to a T but\nfound the soup to be more like a casserole. I had to add 3 additional\ncups of chicken broth after it cooked to get more of a soup consistency.\nThe flavor was okay. I served this to guests who claimed to like it but\nI have to wonder if they were being polite. Wouldn’t make again.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nAnjali6 days ago\n\nObsessed. It is super comforting while not too heavy. My advice: - My\npersonal principle is to not waste stock on pressure cooker recipes.\nJust use water. It will become stock in there anyways. - Wild rice is\nhard to find around here. I used the quick cooking farro from Trader\nJoe's. The 10 min cook time in this recipe yields perfect texture.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nSarah1 week ago\n\nI replaced half the broth with the liquid from soaking some dried\nboletas and porcini mushrooms. I also chopped and tossed in the\nrehydrated mushrooms along with the fresh. Otherwise followed the\nrecipe. It was amazing!\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nBostex2 weeks ago\n\nAdded thinly sliced chicken breast to soup before pressure cooking, then\nstirred in chopped Lacinato kale after natural pressure real ease for 10\nminutes and cooked on normal for a minute or so while stirring soup to\nkeep rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Finished with a little\nsherry in the soup pot and labne in the bowl instead of sour cream.\nReally phenomenal. Wouldn’t omit the kale, it made the soup!\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nIBaker2 weeks ago\n\nI learned my lesson about old wild rice. After an additional 6-8 minutes\nunder pressure it still wasn’t tender. Otherwise the soup was really\ndelicious. Will parboil it next time before adding.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nJK3 weeks ago\n\nI make without the sour cream, we prefer the broth base. Parsley instead\nof dill and a nice crusty baguette with some French butter on the side.\nPerfect!\n\nIs this helpful?[] 1\n\nCecilia1 month ago\n\nI cut butter in half, used black lentils instead of rice for added\nprotein and upped the broth. Next time I’d chop the mushrooms a bit\nsmaller.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nLB1 month ago\n\nI added a few teaspoons of miso paste to this recipe at the end and I\nomitted adding the sour cream to the entire dish. Instead, I put a\ndollop of sour cream in each serving and mixed it. This way I can freeze\nportions without it getting weird.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 1\n\nDill Weed4 months ago\n\nI used dill weed instead of thyme. Tasty!\n\nIs this helpful?[] 1\n\nC5 months ago\n\nDelicious soup recipe! Changes I made: used half the butter and added\nolive oil. Added rehydrated mushroom mix for some extra umami. Followed\nthe wine substitution method but instead of using broth, added the water\nused to soak dehydrated mushrooms. Topped the soup with truffle oil.\nChanges for next time: more rice to add bulk (possibly 1.5 cups)\nDefinitely not a quick weeknight dinner recipe. 1 hour cook time is\naccurate. But good for meal prep and I think has excellent ROI.\n\nIs this helpful?[] 1\n\nMary6 months ago\n\nI just cooked this soup and it’s delicious. I prepared the soup on my\nstove top. Cooked the brown rice/wild rice combination in a separate pot\nwith chicken stock. Cooked all the other ingredients in my large stock\npot separately. I did add butter that was already mixed with white miso\nfrom my refrigerator.. I would serve this with crispy toasted baguettes\nI just cookedand a Caesar salad on the side. I couldn’t be more pleased\nwith this dish. I’m sure that it freezes well. this soup is a winner\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nFaye7 months ago\n\nRice no where near cooked at 12 mins. Put in for another 8 mins. Still\nquite chewy - I know it's supposed to be somewhat, but I probably would\nadd more stock and pressure cook for 20 mins in future. Perhaps I'm less\nadept at chopping, but I wouldn't consider this a week night dish.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nKate8 months ago\n\nThis made a delicious soup! Not the biggest garlic fan for soups, so I\nreduced to 4 garlic cloves and scratched the garlic powder. Added 2 bay\nleaves. The 6 qt instant pot is not big enough to accommodate all the\nmushrooms that this recipe calls for. It can fit 1.5 lbs of mushrooms, 2\nlbs was a bit too ambitious.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nDrake Baer9 months ago\n\nManzanilla instead of red wine. Triple the thyme. Additional butter at\nthe end instead of sour cream. I found the sour cream muddled the\nexquisite taste of the shrooms, butter and sherry. As written, this\ndoesn’t quite work as vegetarian stroganoff.\n\nIs this helpful?[]\n\nErika9 months ago\n\nSo good! Leftovers were excellent too. Easily cooked on the stove-top in\na Dutch oven with slight modification. I added 2 stalks of leeks, as\nthey seemed fitting. I put the firmer vegetables in after the onion to\ncook down and sweat, then put all of the mushrooms in until they shrunk\ntoo. I added the broth, wild rice, etc as directed and let it simmer for\n~45min. Then sour cream, etc. The textures were all perfect that way.\nJust test the rice here and there to taste when it's done. Enjoy!\n\nIs this helpful?[] 1\n\nPrivate notes are only visible to you.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRecipe Tags\n\n-   American\n-   Dry White
