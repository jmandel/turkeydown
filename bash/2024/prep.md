## Prep Schedule
Here's a suggested prep schedule optimized for freshness while spreading out the work:

| Day | Turkey | Gravy | Wild Rice Soup | Green Beans | Broccoli Rabe | Cranberry Sauce | Root Veg Panzanella | Sage Biscuits | Apple Tart | Pumpkin Bundt |
|-----|---------|--------|----------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Sunday Night | Remove backbone, make dry brine, apply to turkey, refrigerate uncovered | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Monday | Continue brining | Make stock from backbone | - | - | - | Make cranberry sauce, refrigerate | - | Roast squash, purée, refrigerate | Make tart dough, wrap & chill | - |
| Tuesday | Continue brining | Strain & refrigerate stock | Make soup base through mushroom sauté, refrigerate | - | - | - | Cube bread, leave out to stale | Mix dry ingredients, store | Roll dough, refrigerate | Make cake, cool completely |
| Wednesday | Continue brining | - | Finish soup, refrigerate | Trim beans, blanch, ice bath, dry, refrigerate | Clean & trim rabe | - | Prep root vegetables | - | Make filling, assemble tart, refrigerate | Make glaze, glaze cake |

Key considerations:
- Turkey starts Sunday to allow full 4-day dry brine
- Stock made Monday from turkey backbone for gravy
- Cranberry sauce benefits from time to set/meld flavors 
- Bread needs time to stale for panzanella
- Components prepped ahead where possible (squash purée, tart dough)
- Most active prep on Tuesday/Wednesday to spread work
- Fresh baking Thursday morning for biscuits and tart
- Final cooking/reheating/assembly Thursday

This schedule allows for:
1. Proper brining time for turkey
2. Make-ahead items that benefit from resting time
3. Fresh preparation where needed
4. Workload distributed across days
5. Optimal timing for each dish's peak quality
6. Logical grouping of similar tasks
7. Manageable Thursday morning schedule
