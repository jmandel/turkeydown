If you want snappy crunch, like the restaurant, skip the boiling. Just throw 'em in an iron skillet with olive oil etc and a lid (to keep oil popping all over) and flip a couple times over a couple minutes. 

To have it somewhere in between do not boil it over 2 minutes... absolute max. I think this recipe was written for throwing frozen beans straight from tbe freezer into the pot, not, fresn beans.

There really isn't any reason to boil them.",

Here is a recipe for fresh green beans, boiled just until barely tender
and bright green, then tossed in a pan with minced garlic and ginger.
The beans can be cooked a day ahead, leaving nothing more to do before
the meal than to assemble everything over high heat.

Preparation

1.  Step 1

    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and fill a large bowl
    with ice water. Working in two batches, boil beans until just tender
    but still crisp and bright green. Start testing after 4 minutes or
    so, being careful not to overcook. When done, plunge beans into ice
    water to stop cooking, lift out immediately when cool and drain on
    towels. (Recipe can be made to this point up to a day in advance and
    kept refrigerated, wrapped in towels.)

2.  Step 2

    When ready to cook, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wide skillet over
    high heat. Add half the beans, half the ginger and half the garlic,
    and cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until beans are heated
    through and ginger and garlic are softened and aromatic. Sprinkle
    with salt, and remove to a serving dish. Repeat with remaining oil,
    beans, ginger and garlic. Serve.

I add 1 T of soy sauce and 1 T of White wine vinegar ( or sherry
vinegar) for a minute, before the ginger and garlic. Delicious.

I never boil beans! They should actually be steamed. Bring the beans to
a boil, then immediately turn off the heat and cover the pot. Let them
sit for a few minutes, taste one to test, then drain.
If you do this, they will be perfect when reheated the next day.

At four minutes of boiling, I had already overcooked the beans. Check
well before then.

We keep bags of fresh ginger in the freezer. When we want to use it in a
finely-shredded way, we use a microplane. No need to thaw or peel --
just grate from frozen.

Neal7 years ago

Don't understand why one would ever boil the beans. Boiling them changes
the taste (dilutes the carbohydrates and thus the sweetness) and leaches
out vitamins and other nutrients. Steaming cooks them more quickly
because steam has a higher temperature than boiling water.

Janet7 years ago

I stop cooking as soon as the color turns bright. Since garlic burns and
turns bitter very quickly on high heat I get the beans heated through,
then add ginger to warm up, add the garlic last, just to warm up and
scent the air. For best flavor, do not let garlic color beyond golden,
remove from pan immediately.

With 2 1/2 lbs of beans, this works very well in a wok, do the whole
thing in one shot. And if you throw in a few mushrooms it works even
better.

I agree with the other posters, the beans get tender VERY quickly and I
would start checking even after 1 minute. Also, I melted down a touch of
butter in a small sauce pan and added the ginger/garlic mixture- heating
and stirring for maybe 2 minutes. I then combined it with the beans in
the skillet. Delicious results!

I enjoy lightly steaming the beans, not cook them through, then saute
them at high heat, adding the garlic, etc. toward the end as not to
scorch.

This was awesome! Will make again and again. I added a bit of fresh

Ginger is fiber and juice, so pressing it won't get you the intensity of
flavor because, as you said, you'll get juice. Grating it on a box
grater will work for incorporation of the flavor, or finely chopping it
will give you bits of intense flavor.

Added a little toasted sesame oil to make it more blatantly Asian. Might
try adding chopped fermented black beans next time for more umami.

Arlene Becker7 years ago

These were great! I thought that maybe the recipe was calling for too
much ginger but it married to the garlic and beans wonderfully. To save
time, I used packaged--Yes, more expensive-- green beans that had
already been cleaned and the stems cut off.

Has anyone ever tried this with black garlic? I’ve not cooked with it
much so wondering what an appropriate sub level would be/when to add.
Thanks!

I found this having had it many times at a local restaurant. And trying
it pulling beans out of boil at 2nin 30 sec. If you want snappy crunch,
like the restaurant, skip the boiling. Just throw 'em in an iron skillet
with olive oil etc and a lid (to keep oil popping all over) and flip a
couple times over a couple minutes. To have it somewhere in between do
not boil it over 2 minutes... absolute max. I think this recipe was
written for throwing frozen beans straight from tbe freezer into the
pot, not, fresn beans. There really isn't any reason to boil them.

This is my new favorite way to cook fresh green beans! I'm glad that I
did step 1 the night before, as that made it an easy side to assemble
(step 2) on a busy night. I wasn't sure I would like the combination of
ginger & garlic, but it was very well received!

Remember Graham Kerr, "The Galloping Gourmet"? He had a similar recipe
using butter instead of vegetable oil and nutmeg instead of ginger. It's
very French and sophisticated, if that's not redundant.
