## Formatted Recipes (#llm)

Here are some recipes for reference:
{{Recipes}}

Now we are going to consolidate. Output each recipe markdown with title, detailed ingredients including quantities, and prep steps written clearly. Output all recipes without waiting for confirmation or pausing for for review, just use your judgment and output all recipes. I have set the character limit to ensure your output will fit, so do not stop prematurely. Separate each recipe with a line of "---". The output recipes should be for each of the following: {{Dishes to Prepare}}.

## Prep Plan (#llm)

Here is a series of recipes we are going to make for Thanksgiving:
{{Formatted Recipes}}

Now we'll create a prep schedule starting Sunday night through mealtime Thursday, emphasizing make-ahead where it improves or doesn't detract from quality -- while also consolidating prep steps smartly.

Now output a table where the rows are days (Sunday night, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday), and include a separate column for each of the following dishes: {{Dishes to Prepare}}. This way we can see what prep steps should happen at which cell (time x dish).

Notes:
  * Focus Sunday on Turkey prep only.
  * Baked goods should be baked fresh on Thanksgiving unless they strictly benefit form make-ahead.


## Shopping List (#llm)

Here is a set of formatted recipes:
{{Formatted Recipes}}

Now prepare a combined shopping list based on the formatted recipes you provided. Organize by grocery department and all duplicate ingredients combined to create totals, but listing the dishes and subquantities where they're used in parens. Use markdown and check boxes (☐) for a list that's easy to print/use.
